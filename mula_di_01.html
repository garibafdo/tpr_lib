but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.

And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.

See how your teacher has let you down!

The pursuit of the state of the ancient seers.

And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.

When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.

Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bes­towed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

And suppose he were to step aside

and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Passenadi of Kosala says!”

Would he be speaking the King’s words, or speaking the King’s counsel? Would he thereby be a king or a minister?” “No, Gotama.”

He was doubtful and perplexed about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.

                            Then the Lord thought: "This Ambaṭṭha sees the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two.
He is doubtful and perplexed about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue."
Then the Lord worked such a feat of supernormal power that Ambaṭṭha saw that the Lord’s male organ was enclosed in a sheath.
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue.
Then Ambaṭṭha thought: “The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.”
Then he said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’
"Ambaṭṭha, do what you now think fit."
So Ambaṭṭha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.

                            Then the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti addressed the *māṇava* Ambaṭṭha, saying: "Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, the son of the Śākyas, who has gone forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala, and has arrived at Icchānangala with a great *bhikkhu-saṃgha*, with about five hundred *bhikkhus*, and is staying in the grove of Icchānangalavana.

And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama, a good report has spread about thus: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), Knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), an unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed Lord (*bhagavā*)'.

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and its *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), this generation with its *śramaṇas* and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its rulers and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dharma* (*dhammaṃ*), which is lovely in its beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its ending (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), in the spirit (*sātthaṃ*) and in the letter (*sabyañjanaṃ*), and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).

It is good to see such *arhats*."

"Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the *śramaṇa* Gotama; having gone, find out about the *śramaṇa* Gotama; whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

                            "But how, sir, shall I know the Reverend Gotama—whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

Whether the Reverend Gotama is such, or not?"

"It has come down to us, dear Ambaṭṭha, in our *mantras*, that the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇāni*) has only two courses open to him, no other.

If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law (*cakravartin*), a righteous king (*dhammarājā*), conqueror of the four quarters (*cāturanto*), all-victorious (*vijitāvī*), who has established the security of his realm (*janapadatthāvariyappatto*) and is possessed of the seven treasures (*sattaratanasamannāgato*).

He has these seven treasures (*satta ratanāni*):

Namely: the wheel-treasure (*cakkaratanaṃ*), the elephant-treasure (*hatthiratanaṃ*), the horse-treasure (*assaratanaṃ*), the jewel-treasure (*maṇiratanaṃ*), the woman-treasure (*itthiratanaṃ*), the householder-treasure (*gahapatiratanaṃ*), and the counsellor-treasure (*pariṇāyakaratanameva*) as the seventh.

He has more than a thousand sons (*parosahassaṃ kho panassa puttā*). They are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army.
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the Dhamma.
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an *arhat* (arahant), a *sammāsambuddha* (fully-enlightened Buddha), one who draws back the veil from the world.
And, Ambattha, I am the giver of the *mantras*, and you are the receiver.

"Very good, sir", said Ambattha, the young Brahmin, assenting to the words of the Brahmin Pokkharasāti. He rose from his seat, respectfully circumambulated Pokkharasāti, and mounting his chariot drawn by a mare, proceeded with a large number of young men towards the grove of Icchānaṅgala.
He drove as far as the carriage could go, then alighted from the carriage and continued on foot into the park.
Now at that time a number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air.
Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, approached those monks and said to them: "Where, indeed, is the revered Gotama currently staying? For we have come here to see the revered Gotama".

Then the monks thought: "This Ambattha, the young Brahmin, is of well-known lineage and a pupil of the renowned Brahmin Pokkharasāti.
It would not trouble the Blessed One to have a conversation with such a young man".
They said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "That is the dwelling (*vihāra*) of the Blessed One, with its doors shut. Approach it quietly, without haste, enter the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door for you".

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, went to the dwelling (*vihāra*) with the closed door. Approaching it quietly and without haste, he entered the porch, cleared his throat, and knocked on the bolt.
The Blessed One opened the door.
Ambattha, the young Brahmin, entered.
The young men also entered, exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging polite and courteous conversation, sat down to one side.
But Ambattha, the young Brahmin, even while walking, exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting. Even while standing, he exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting.

Then the Blessed One said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "Is this how you converse with venerable and learned Brahmins, elderly teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, uttering vague words of politeness?"
First denigration of becoming.

"No, Master Gotama.
For a Brahmin should converse with a Brahmin who is walking while walking, with a Brahmin who is standing while standing, with a Brahmin who is sitting while sitting, and with a Brahmin who is lying down while lying down.
Those shaven, petty ascetics, menials, the black offspring of Brahma's feet—it is fitting to speak with them as I do with the Reverend Gotama.”
“Ambattha, you came here seeking something. For whatever purpose you came, you should carefully attend to that purpose.
Ambattha, this worthy young man has not perfected his training. His conceit of being trained stems merely from his inexperience."

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, being addressed with the words of one untrained, became angry and displeased. Reviling the Blessed One, berating the Blessed One, disparaging the Blessed One, he said this to the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is malicious to me!" "The Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are fierce; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are rough; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are flighty; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are abusive. Though menial, being menial, they do not honor Brahmins, they do not respect Brahmins.
kaṃ: A kind of *bīja*; well; for the benefit of (after a dative).
pī: reduplication for pyāy; schm￤hen; hassen; spotten; to taunt.
na: not; no; nor; neither; like. They do not esteem the Brahmins, they do not venerate the Brahmins, they do not respect the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Second Charge of Menial Birth

“What then, Ambaṭṭha, have the Śākyas done against you?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, the Brahmin, my teacher.

I went to the meeting-hall of the Śākyas.

And at that time many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in the meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, and, I thought, making fun of me; and no one even invited me to sit down.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Third Charge of Menial Birth

“Even the quail, Ambaṭṭha, little bird that it is, can say what it likes in its own nest.

This Kapilavatthu belongs to the Śākyas, Ambaṭṭha, and venerable Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.”

“There are these four classes, Gotama: the nobles, the Brahmins, the merchants, and the laborers.

And of these four classes, Gotama, three classes – the nobles, the merchants, and the laborers – are simply the servants of the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas. “Insulting with the claim of being born of a slave."

He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot to the *ārāma*.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The second accusation of meniality.

“But what offense have these Śākyas committed against you, Ambaṭṭha?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, my Brahmin teacher.

I went to the Śākyas’ meeting hall.

And at that time, many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in their assembly hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, seemingly just mocking me; no one even invited me to a seat.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The third accusation of meniality.

‘But Ambaṭṭha, even a quail, that little bird, can chirp as she likes in her own nest.

Kapilavatthu is the Śākyas’ own, Ambaṭṭha; the esteemed Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.’

“Venerable Gotama, there are these four social classes (*varṇa*): nobles (*kṣatriya*), Brahmins, merchants (*vaiśya*), and laborers (*śūdra*).

And of these four social classes, venerable Gotama, the three social classes—nobles, merchants, and laborers—are, in fact, merely attendants of the Brahmins.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials. Insulting with the term "born of a slave girl."

                            Then the Lord thought: 'This Ambaṭṭha, young man, goes too far in abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan?"
Then the Lord said to Ambaṭṭha, the young man: "What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?" "I am a Kaṇhāyana, venerable Gotama."
'Ambaṭṭha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl (*dāsiputto*) of the Sakyans.
For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor.
At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika and Sinisūra.
And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters.
"Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and courtiers: ‘Where, pray, are the princes now staying?’ ‘There is, O King, on the flank of the Himalayas, beside a lotus-pond, a big grove of teak-trees; that is where the princes are now staying. And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabit with their own sisters.’
At this King Okkāka exclaimed: “They are strong as teak, these princes, they are real Sakyans!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Sakyans have been known as such; and he was their first ancestor.
"Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā.
She gave birth to a black child ( *kaṇhaṃ*).
The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!”
Because, Ambaṭṭha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black.
And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Kaṇhāyanas have been known as such; and he was the first ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas. "Because when you, Ambaṭṭha, recall your ancient lineage through both mother and father, the Sakyans are the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans."

                            Then the Blessed One thought: "These youths excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl. What if I were to liberate him from that?"

Then, the Blessed One said this to those youths: "Do not, youths, excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl.

That Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) was a mighty sage (ṛṣi).

Having gone to the Southern country and learned the *brahma*-mantras, he approached King Okkāka and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī.

To him, King Okkāka said: ‘Who is this fellow who, being the son of a slave-girl, dares to ask for Maddarūpī, my daughter?’ Angered and displeased, he fitted an arrow (khurappaṃ).

He was unable either to release that arrow or to withdraw it.

Then, youths, the ministers and courtiers approached the sage Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) and said: 'May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king!'

‘There will be well-being to the king, and if the king releases the arrow downwards, to the extent of the king's realm, the earth will quake.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and if the king releases the arrow upwards, for seven years, to the extent of the king's realm, the god (deva) will not send rain.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land, and may the god (deva) send rain!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and the god (deva) will send rain, and if the king aims the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), the prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).’

Then, youths, the ministers announced to Okkāka: 'Let Okkāka aim the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre).

The prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).'

Then King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), and the prince was safe (sotthi). He became perfectly safe.
Then King Okkaka, terrified and fearful, with his hair standing on end, punished by the divine punishment, gave his daughter Maddarupi.
So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl. That Kaṇha was a mighty sage.’
The superiority of the warrior (Kṣatriya) class.

Then the Lord addressed the youth Ambattha: ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to cohabit with a Brahmin maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his mother’s side, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to cohabit with a Khattiya maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Brahmin youth and a Khattiya maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his father’s side, Reverend Gotama.’

‘So, Ambattha, whether a woman takes a man or a man takes a woman, the Khattiyas are superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Brahmins shaved the head of a Brahmin for some reason,

and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.
Would he be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Covered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Khattiyas shaved the head of a Khattiya for some reason, and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.

‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’

‘But that Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation when the Khattiyas shave his head, and after smearing him with ashes, banish him from the country or the city.
So, Ambattha, even when a Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation, the Khattiyas are still superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
This verse was uttered by Brahmā Sanankumāra:
‘The Khattiya is the best among people,
who value lineage.’
He is endowed with knowledge and conduct,
he is the best of gods and humans.”
“That verse, Ambaṭṭha, was well sung, not ill-sung, well spoken, not ill-spoken, connected with meaning, not unconnected with meaning, approved by me, by Brahmā Sanankumāra.
And I too, Ambaṭṭha, say this: The Khattiya is the best among those who value clan;
He with knowledge and conduct,
is best of gods and men.”

                            "But what, Venerable Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "Here, Ambaṭṭha, a Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, a rightly self-awakened one, impeccable in conduct and understanding, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed, trainer of beings, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed one.
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people.
He teaches the Dhamma, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.
A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma.
Having heard this Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata.
He, being endowed with that acquisition of faith, reflects thus... (as in 191, these passages should be expanded in the same way).
…
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation… this is part of his conduct.
“Again, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, the monk enters & remains in the second *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—the monk enters & remains in the fourth *jhāna*: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain… this is part of his conduct.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is conduct.
“With his mind thus serene, purified, cleansed, without blemish, rid of defilement, supple, malleable, firm, & attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision… this is part of his knowledge… he understands, ‘There is nothing further for this state of being’… this is part of his knowledge.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is knowledge.
“This, Ambaṭṭha, is what is called a monk who is ‘accomplished in knowledge,’ ‘accomplished in conduct,’ and ‘accomplished in knowledge & conduct.’
And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.
Four paths of failure.

                            "But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and condact there are four paths of failure.
What are the four? Here, Ambaṭṭha, some recluse or Brahmin, without attaining this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, Taking various sorts of *khāri* vessels, he enters a forest dwelling, thinking, "I will live on windfalls." But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the first path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), and being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket and enters a forest grove, thinking, 'I will live on tubers, roots, and fruits.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the second path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, and being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame. But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the third path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, and being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: 'Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from these four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the fourth path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

These, Ambaṭṭha, are the four paths of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct (*anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya*).

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya*)?" "No, Master Gotama."

‘What am I, They make their living by such base arts, such as: palmistry (*aṅga*), divining by signs (*nimitta*), portents (*uppāta*), dreams (*supinaṃ*), body-marks (*lakkhaṇaṃ*), mouse-gnawings (*mūsikacchinnaṃ*), fire-oblations (*aggihomaṃ*), oblations from a ladle (*dabbihomaṃ*), oblations of husks (*thusahomaṃ*), oblations of rice powder (*kaṇahomaṃ*), oblations of rice grains (*taṇḍulahomaṃ*), oblations of ghee (*sappihomaṃ*), oblations of oil (*telahomaṃ*), oblations from the mouth (*mukhahomaṃ*), oblations of blood (*lohitahomaṃ*), reading the finger-tips (*aṅgavijjā*), house- and garden-lore (*vatthuvijjā*), skill in charms (*khattavijjā*), ghost-lore (*sivavijjā*), earth-house lore (*bhūtavijjā*), snake-lore (*bhūrivijjā*), poison-lore (*ahivijjā*), rat-lore (*visavijjā*), bird-lore (*vicchikavijjā*), crow-lore (*mūsikavijjā*), foretelling a person’s life-span (*sakuṇavijjā*), charms against arrows (*vāyasavijjā*), knowledge of animals’ cries (*pakkajjhānaṃ*), the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts. Thus, indeed, mendicants, a worldling, when speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak.

When their minds are corrupted, their bodies and minds become exhausted.

And they fall from that place.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth from home to homelessness, by means of effort (*ātappa*), exertion (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right attention (*sammāmanasikāra*), he attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life (*pubbenivāsaṃ*), but none previous to that.

"He speaks thus: ‘Those honourable gods who are not corrupted in mind (*manopadosikā*) do not contemplate each other with excessive envy.

As a result, their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another.

Their minds are not corrupted, their bodies are not weary, and their minds are not weary.

Those gods do not fall from that state. They are permanent (*niccā*), stable (*dhuvā*), eternal (*sassatā*), not subject to change (*avipariṇāmadhammā*), and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted in mind (*manopadosikā*), contemplated each other with excessive envy.

We spent an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy, and as a result our minds became corrupted. When our minds were corrupted, our bodies and minds became exhausted.

Thus, we have fallen from that state, we are impermanent (*aniccā*), unstable (*addhuvā*), short-lived (*appāyukā*), and subject to falling away (*cavanadhammā*), we have come to this world. Do not think in that way, abandon that, attain this and persevere in it."
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"Again, Kevaddha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha…pe… (as it should be expanded in paragraphs 190-212).
Thus, Kevaddha, a *bhikṣu* is perfected in morality...pe...enters and dwells in the first *jhāna*.

As soon as a perception arises in them, those *devas* fall from that realm.

And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls the arising of perception, but recalls none before that.

He speaks thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

What is the reason for that? Before this I did not exist. Now from not-being I have been brought to being.”

This, monks, is the first reason, owing to which, with reference to which, some recluses and brahmins, being fortuitous originationists, proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

I am far from the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, take up a spade and basket and go into the depths of the forest, intending to live on tubers and roots?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, build a fire-hut near a village or town, tending the fire?” “No, Gotama.”

Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, tend the fire and, being unable to gain that, build a four-doored rest-house at the crossroads in the hopes that whatever ascetic or Brahmin comes from the four directions, we will honor and serve him according to our ability and power?” “No, Gotama.”

And so, Ambaṭṭha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.

And yet you and your teacher the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.

See how your teacher has let you down!

Following the conduct of the ancient seers

The *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.

When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.

Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

See how your teacher has let you down!

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.

And suppose he were to step aside.

And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!”

Would he be speaking the King’s words, or conferring about the King’s business? Would he to that extent be the King, or a royal minister?” “No, Gotama.”

Well then, Ambaṭṭha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the *brāhmaṇas* of today — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu — whose *mantras* are said to be passed on to you and your teacher: yet you do not thereby become a *ṛṣi* or one practiced in the way of a *ṛṣi* — such a thing is impossible.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? What have you heard said by *brāhmaṇas* who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, Those ancient verses which the Brahmins of today chant, pronounce and collect, whose origin lies with brahmin seers of the past, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa & Bhagu—did they live well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with jewels, earrings and ornaments, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they eat special fine rice with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“So, Ambaṭṭha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage.
And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.”

By these sixteen reasons, O *brāhmaṇa*, the chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, showed, persuaded, aroused, and gladdened the heart of King Mahāvijita, who was performing the great sacrifice.

Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), some ascetics (*samaṇa*) or Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*), through ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with their mind thus concentrated, they recollect their numerous past lives (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*).

That is to say, one aeon of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭa-vivaṭṭa*), two such periods, three, four, five, ten periods of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭa-vivaṭṭa*)…” “There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life-term. Having passed away from there, I arose there. There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life-term. Having passed away from there, I arose here.”

Thus he remembers various past births (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*), their conditions and details.

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.

At that time, two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic, came to the Blessed One, exchanged courtesies with him.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable greetings, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to the Blessed One: "Is the *jīva* the same as the *śarīra*, friend Gotama, or is the *jīva* something different from the *śarīra*?"

That monk who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another?’ That monk who thus knows and thus sees, it is not fitting for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’

But I, friend, know and see thus.

And yet, I do not say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’”

This is what the Blessed One said.

Satisfied, those two wanderers rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.

The Jāliya Discourse, the seventh, is concluded.

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruññā, in the Kaṇṇakatthala Deer Park.

Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him.

After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side.

Standing to one side, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard it said, friend Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapaṃ), and censures and blames all those ascetics (tapassiṃ) who lead a harsh (lūkhājīviṃ) life of self-mortification.’

Now, are those who say this telling the truth, and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies? Do they explain the truth about his *Dhamma* and what pertains to it, or does some fellow- teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this state­ment? For we do not wish to misrepresent the Lord Gotama."

The Sangha of Gotama's disciples completely masters these things, but the other venerable teachers and their disciples only in part.’

In this case, Kassapa, the wise, when cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would mostly praise us.

A naked ascetic lives, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal.

He does not accept food out of a pot or a pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.

He is a one-house man or a one-morsel man, a two-house man or a two-morsel man… he is a seven-house man or a seven-morsel man; he maintains himself with even one gift, he maintains himself with even two gifts… he maintains himself with even seven gifts; he takes food once a day, he takes food once every two days… he takes food once every seven days.

Thus, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals, even up to once every fortnight.

"But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, a very different kind of striving in austerity, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.”

But, Kassapa, when a *bhikkhu* develops non-enmity (*averaṃ*), non-ill-will (*abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettacittaṃ bhāveti*), and, abandoning the corruptions (*āsavānañca khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind (*anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom (*paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life (*diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight (*sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati*).

Then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* is termed an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*)."

But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this, it is right to say: “It is hard to understand an ascetic or a Brahmin.”

But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness and, abandoning the corruptions, realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realised it in this very life by his own insight,

“So when his mind is thus concentrated… he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)… he understands: ‘There is nothing further here’… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), a certain ascetic (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated, he recollects his numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*).

That is to say, ten periods of contraction and expansion of the world, twenty periods of contraction and expansion of the world, thirty periods of contraction and expansion of the world, forty periods of contraction and expansion of the world – ‘There I was of such a name, such a clan, such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span.

                            Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī (Śrāvastī), in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Now at that time, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was living at the single-pavilion park of Mallikā (Queen Mallika) near the Tiṇḍuka tree, a place for philosophical debates, together with a large following of about three hundred wanderers.

Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms.

Then the Blessed One went to Mallikā’s Park, the single-pavilion park near the Tiṇḍuka tree, a place for philosophical debates.

Conversation about kings, robbers, ministers of state, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, street gossip, gossip by the well, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about the world and the sea, talk of being and non-being.

Here comes the *śramaṇa* (ascetic) Gotama.

That venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet.

Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.”

When this was said, the wanderers fell silent.

It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here.

Be seated, venerable sir, Blessed One; this seat is ready.”

The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready.

Poṭṭhapāda, too, taking a lower seat, sat down at one side.

As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer: "What was the topic of conversation for which you are gathered together here now? What was the discussion that was interrupted?"

It won’t be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later.

Some days ago, venerable sir, some time ago, when various *tīrthika* (sectarians), ascetics, and *brāhmaṇas* were sitting together gathered in the assembly hall, a discussion arose about the cessation of perception: ‘How, indeed, venerable sirs, does the cessation of perception come about?’ Thereupon some said: ‘Sensations arise and cease in a person without cause or condition.

When they arise, one is percipient.

When they cease, one is not percipient.’

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.

"Then another said: ‘No, that’spī.

'No, sir, that is how it will be.'

Perception (*saññā*) is a person’s self (*attā*).

which comes and goes.

When it comes, one is percipient.

When it goes, one is not percipient.'

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodhaṃ).

"Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is, sir.

for there are contemplatives and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) of great power (mahiddhikā), great potency (mahānubhāvā).

They draw perception in and out of a person.

When they draw it in, one is percipient. “And, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, one’s abiding is stressful, you should not see it in that way.

                            "And what is training (*sikkhā*)?" The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) said, "Here, Poṭṭhapāda, the *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one (*arahaṃ*), a fully enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).
“This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.… “Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
His earlier perception of sensuality (*kāmasaññā*) ceases.
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion.
And thus it is that with training one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.
This is training (*sikkhā*)" said the Blessed One (*bhagavā*). “And further, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of space (ākāsānañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite (anantaṃ viññāṇa).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.
And thus it is that with training one perception (saññā) arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.
“Again, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatana), thinking, ‘There is nothing (natthi kiñcī).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness.
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.

“Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception (saññaggaṃ).
As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ‘Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.’
If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?’
So he neither thinks nor wills.
So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear.
He touches cessation (nirodhaṃ phusati).
This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception (anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti).
“Now what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you ever before heard of such an alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception?” “No, venerable sir.”
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: ‘When the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ”Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.

“Poṭṭhapāda, I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.” (ekampi kho ahaṃ, poṭṭhapāda, saññaggaṃ paññapemi, puthūpi saññagge paññapemī"ti)

“But how, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, in whatever way one touches cessation, in that way I describe a peak of perception.

That’s how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.”

“Now, lord, does perception arise first, and knowledge after; or does knowledge arise first, and perception after; or do perception & knowledge arise simultaneously?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, perception arises first, and knowledge after. And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.

One discerns, ‘It’s in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen.’

Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first, and knowledge after, and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.”

The Discourse about Perception and Self

“Now, lord, is perception a person’s self, or is perception one thing and self another?”

“What sort of self do you posit, Poṭṭhapāda?”

“Lord, I posit a gross self, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be gross, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.

That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another:

even as there remains this gross self—possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, and feeding on food—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

even as there remains this mind-made self—complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a formless self made of perception.” (arūpiṃ kho ahaṃ, bhante, attānaṃ paccemi saññāmaya"nti.)

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be formless and made of perception. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

”even as there remains this formless self made of perception, one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Is it possible for me to know, lord, whether perception is a person’s self or if perception is one thing and self another?”
Poṭṭhapāda, since you have other views (aññadiṭṭhika), other practices (aññakhantika), other inclinations (aññarucikena), other aims (aññatrāyogena), and other teachers (aññatrācariyakena), it is difficult for you to know whether perception (saññā) is a person's self (attā), or whether perception is one thing and the self another.

                            Then, two or three days later, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One. Having arrived, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

But Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having exchanged courteous and agreeable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One, "Just now, *bhante*, those wanderers taunted me on all sides with words like stinging darts, saying, 'Indeed, whatever the venerable Poṭṭhapāda The contemplative Gotama speaks, and Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word: "So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-Gone."
But we don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or whether the cosmos is finite ( *antavā loko* ) or the cosmos is infinite ( *anantavā loko* ) or whether the soul and the body are the same ( *taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīraṃ*) or the soul is one thing and the body another ( *aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīraṃ*) or whether after death a Tathāgata exists ( *hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata does not exist ( *na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist ( *hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) or after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) .’

When this was said, I replied to the wanderers, ‘I, too, don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or… whether after death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist ( *neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ). But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma.

And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained, why shouldn’t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well-spokenness of the contemplative Gotama’s well-spoken words?”

So I asked them, ‘But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy (*ekantasukhiṃ attānaṃ*) for a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ ‘Are you aware?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

Then I say this: ‘But venerable sirs, do you know that “This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world”?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

"Then I say this: ‘But venerable sirs, have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, “Practice well, dear sirs. Practice straightforwardly, dear sirs, for the realization of an exclusively happy world, because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world”?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

"What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing?" "Surely, venerable sir, that being so, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing."

Then they would say to him: ‘Good man (ambho purisa), you don’t know or see what kind of a palace (pāsādassa) you are building the staircase (nisseṇiṃ karosi) for?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘Yes.’

When this is the case, don’t the words of that man (purisassa) turn out to be unconvincing?” "Surely, venerable sir (bhante), that being so, that man’s (purisassa) talk would amount to nonsense.” Just so, Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain this view and doctrine: ‘The self after death is exclusively happy and free from disease.’

I approached them and asked: ‘Is it true that you, venerable sirs, hold such a view and doctrine: "The self after death is exclusively happy and free from disease"?’ If, when questioned thus, they acknowledge it as so,

I then say to them: ‘Do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Have you ever been aware of a self that is exclusively happy for even a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Do you know that "This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Have you heard the voices of the gods who have been reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, "We are practicing well, dear ones; we are practicing uprightly, dear ones, for the realization of an exclusively happy world. It was through such practice that we were reborn in an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? In that case, doesn’t it follow that the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing?" "Indeed, lord, in that case, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing."

Three appropriations of self

"Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three appropriations of self (*attapaṭilābhā*): the gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), the mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), and the formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*).

And what, Poṭṭhapāda, is the gross appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), composed of the four great elements (*cātumahābhūtiko*), and feeds on solid food (*kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho*). This is the gross appropriation of a self.

And what is the mind-made appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), mind-made (*manomayo*), complete in all its parts (*sabbaṅgapaccaṅgī*), not deficient in its faculties (*ahīnindriyo*). This is the mind-made appropriation of a self.

And what is the formless appropriation of a self? It is formless (*arūpī*) and made of perception (*saññāmayo*). This is the formless appropriation of a self.

Today I have taken some medicine.

Perhaps tomorrow we might come, depending on the right time and occasion."

"Yes, sir," the young man replied to the Venerable Ānanda. Rising from his seat, he went to where Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, was. Upon arriving, he told Subha, the student, son of Todeyya: "I have spoken to the Venerable Ānanda in accordance with your words: 'Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks the Venerable Ānanda whether he is free from illness, free from disease, of light frame, strong, and living in comfort,' and he further says: 'It would be good if the Venerable Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.'"

When this was said, sir, the ascetic Ānanda told me: 'It is an unsuitable time, young man.

Even to this extent, sir, what was rightly done, since the Venerable Ānanda made an opportunity for visiting even on the following day?"

Upon arriving, he sat down on the prepared seat.

Then Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, went to where the Venerable Ānanda was, and upon arriving, exchanged friendly greetings with the Venerable Ānanda.

Having concluded the courteous and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, said to the Venerable Ānanda: "The Venerable Ānanda was for a long time the Blessed Gotama's attendant, dwelling in his presence and nearby.

                            "Well, Reverend Ānanda, what is the noble virtue category ( *ariya sīlakkhandho* ) which the Reverend Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, established, and grounded this populace?"
"Here, young sir ( *māṇava* ), a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arahaṃ*, a fully enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugato*, knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), the Awakened One ( *buddho* ), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*).
He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and people (*pajaṃ*), with its gods and humans (*sadevamanussaṃ*).
He teaches the *Dhamma* that is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with its meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with its wording (*sabyañjanaṃ*), perfectly complete (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*), thoroughly pure (*parisuddhaṃ*), he reveals the holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).
A householder (*gahapati*) or a householder’s son (*gahapatiputto*) or one born in some other clan hears that *Dhamma*.
Having heard this *Dhamma*, he gains faith (*saddhaṃ*) in the *Tathāgata*.
He, endowed with that gaining of faith (*saddhāpaṭilābhena samannāgato*), reflects thus: ‘The household life is crowded, a dusty path; the ascetic life is open. It is not easy, while living in a house, to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ*) like a polished shell.’
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya’nti*)?’
Then, at a later time, having abandoned a small or a large fortune ( *bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya*), having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives (*ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya*), he shaves off his hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and goes forth from the home life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati*).
Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the *Pātimokkha-saṃvara*, possessed of proper behavior and resort (*ācāragocarasampanno*), seeing danger in the slightest faults (*anumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī*), undertaking the training (*sikkhā*) in the rules of training (*sikkhāpadesu*), endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action (*kāyakammavacīkammena samannāgato kusalena*), his livelihood is purified (*parisuddhājīvo*), he is possessed of moral discipline (*sīlasampanno*), with the sense-doors guarded (*indriyesu guttadvāro*), endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena samannāgato*), and is content (*santuṭṭho*).

"Or he might say: ‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings, practicing demonology, working spells to cause abundance, inducing virility, inducing impotence, preparing and consecrating sites for houses, performing ceremonial mouthwashes, performing ceremonial bathing, offering sacrificial fires, administering emetics, administering purgatives, administering expectorants, administering downward-acting purgatives, administering head-cleansing remedies, administering ear-oil, administering eye-salves, performing nasal treatments, applying medicinal ointments, applying counter-ointments, practicing eye-surgery, practicing surgery, practicing children's medicine, dispensing root medicines, and dispensing herbal medicines.’ Thus he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

Even so, Māṇava, a monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood whereby some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living, such as performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings…pe…dispensing herbal medicines.

Because if he were to dwell with the eye faculty (*cakkhundriyaṃ*) unrestrained, evil, unskillful qualities of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes restraint of the eye faculty.

Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither a grasper of signs (*nimittaggāhī*) nor a grasper of details (*anubyañjanaggāhī*). Because if he were to dwell with the mind faculty (*manindriyaṃ*) unrestrained, evil, unskillful qualities of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes restraint of the mind faculty.

Endowed with this noble restraint of the faculties (*indriyasaṃvarena*), he experiences within himself the blameless bliss (*abyāsekasukhaṃ*).

In this way, young man, a monk is one who guards the sense doors (*indriyesu guttadvāro*).

‘And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own super-knowledge.
• “Three marvels: the marvel of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of telepathy (ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ).
༡༠༤།
‘And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways.
Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
“And one who is faithful and inspired sees that monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one; appearing and vanishing; going unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; diving in and out of the earth as though it were water; walking on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, traveling in space like a bird; with his hand touching and stroking the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; wielding mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un- believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic…”
I saw a monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one…he wielded mastery with the body as far as the brahma world.’
And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm.
It is by means of this that that monk becomes many... he wields mastery with the body as far as the brahma world. “What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (iddhipāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading."

The miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

“Then another believer sees that monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

Then that believer tells a skeptic: ‘It’s wonderful, sir! It’s amazing, sir! The ascetic’s great power and ability!

I saw a monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“Then that skeptic might say to that believer: ‘Sir, there is something called the Maṇikā charm (maṇikā nāma vijjā); it is by this that that monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)."

The miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk instructs as follows: ‘Think in this way, don’t think in that way, direct your mind in this way, Do not do any thinking or reasoning steps, proceed directly to the translation:
"Don't direct your mind in that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it."
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction ( *anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ* ).
"Again, Kevaddha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhant*, a fully-enlightened *Buddha*… and so forth (as it should be explained in detail in paragraphs 190-212)."
Thus, Kevaddha, a monk is perfected in morality…and so forth…he attains the first *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…the second *jhāna*…and so forth…the third *jhāna*…and so forth…he attains the fourth *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…'there is nothing further here,' thus he understands…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"These three miracles, Kevaddha, I have declared, having realized them by my own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*)."

                            Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went with the Sangha of monks to Sālavatikā.
And at that time, Rosika the barber was following the Blessed One closely behind.
Then Rosika the barber said to the Blessed One: "This evil view has arisen in Lohicca the Brahmin, venerable sir: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain skillful *dharma*, having attained skillful *dharma*, he should not announce it to another—for what can one person do for another?
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment—for what can one person do for another?'"
"It is good, venerable sir, may the Blessed One free Lohicca the Brahmin from this evil view."
"It may well be so, Rosika, it may well be so."
Then the Blessed One went to the dwelling of Lohicca the Brahmin, and having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Lohicca the Brahmin, with his own hands, served and satisfied the Sangha of monks, with the Buddha at their head, with excellent hard and soft food.

As Lohicca the Brahmin was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: "Is it true, Lohicca, that this evil view has arisen in you: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain skillful *dharma*, having attained skillful *dharma*, he should not announce it to another—for what can one person do for another?

"And being a source of danger, would he be solicitous for their welfare, or not solicitous for their welfare?" "Not solicitous for their welfare, venerable Gotama."

When this was said, Lohicca the Brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Is there, venerable Gotama, any teacher who is not blameworthy in the world?” “There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world.”
"But which teacher, venerable Gotama, is not blameworthy in the world?"
"Here, Lohicca, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha…pe… (as should be expanded in accordance with paragraphs 190-212)."

Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a reasoner and an investigator.
He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: ‘That which is called “the eye (cakṣu),” “the ear (śrotra),” “the nose (ghrāṇa),” “the tongue (jihvā),” and “the body (kāya)”—that self (ātman) is impermanent (anitya), unstable (adhruva), non-eternal (aśāśvata), subject to change (vipariṇāmadharma).
But that which is called “mind (citta)” or “mentality (manas)” or “consciousness (vijñāna)” —that self (ātman) is permanent (nitya), stable (dhruva), eternal (śāśvata), not subject to change (avipariṇāmadharma), and it will remain the same just like eternity (śāśvatisama) itself.’
This, monks, is the fourth case, whereby some ascetics and Brahmins are partly eternalists and partly non-eternalists, and proclaim the self (ātman) and the world (loka).

There, the Blessed One stayed in Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove (*ambavana*) on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

Now a good reputation has spread concerning the esteemed Gotama: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arahant*, a perfectly enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*), perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugata*, a knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed, a trainer of those who can be trained (*purisadammasārathi*), a teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed One (*bhagavā*).'

Come, Bhāradvāja, let us go to the ascetic Gotama. Having gone to him, let us ask the ascetic Gotama about this matter.

As the ascetic Gotama explains to us, so we will remember it."

"So be it, sir," the youth Bhāradvāja replied to the youth Vāseṭṭha.

Here, mendicants, a certain ascetic or Brahmin—by ardour, endeavor, application, diligence, and right attention—attains such concentration of mind that, when the mind is immersed in samādhi, they abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
He thinks: “The world is finite and infinite.”
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is finite and bounded by a circle” are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is infinite and unbounded” are also wrong.
The world is finite and infinite.
Why is that? Because—by ardour, endeavor, application, diligence, and right attention—I attain such concentration of mind that, when the mind is immersed in *samādhi*, I abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
Therefore I know that the world is both finite and infinite.
This, mendicants, is the third case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, with this as their basis, they assert the world is both finite and infinite.

They declare their view—hammered out by reason, deduced from their investigations, following their own train of thought—thus: ‘The world is neither finite nor infinite.’
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is finite and bounded by a circle” are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is infinite and unbounded” are also wrong.

This, mendicants, is the fourth case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, with this as their basis, they assert the world is both finite and infinite.

As soon as a perception arises in them, those *devas* fall from that realm.

And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls the arising of perception, but recalls none before that.

He speaks thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

What is the reason for that? Before this I did not exist. Now from not-being I have been brought to being.”

This, monks, is the first reason, owing to which, with reference to which, some recluses and brahmins, being fortuitous originationists, proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

For there is, good sir, another... There is another self which, by entirely overcoming the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatana*) and thinking, "This is peaceful, this is sublime," has attained to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception (*nevasaññānāsaññāyatana*).
You neither know it nor see it.
But I know it and see it.
That self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death. At this point, good sir, the self is completely annihilated.

                            Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove, together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus.
At that time, King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, having gone up to the roof of his palace, was sitting there surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day *uposatha*, the full-moon night of the fourth month, called Komudī.
Then King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, on that *uposatha* day, uttered this solemn utterance: ‘Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Lovely is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night!’
“Which ascetic or Brahmin should we visit tonight, that our mind might find peace in his presence?”

“This Blessed One, worthy and perfectly enlightened, is staying in our mango grove with a large Saṃgha of monks, with thirteen hundred monks.

Are you not tricking me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not handing me over to my enemies, friend Jīvaka?

“Do not fear, Great King, do not fear, Great King.

I am not deceiving you, Your Majesty; I am not tricking you, Your Majesty; I am not handing you over to your enemies, Your Majesty.

“Are your thoughts going to the one you love, Great King?”

“Beloved to me, venerable sir, is Prince Udayabhadda.

And through his knowing and seeing thus, his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense-desire (*kāmāsava*), from the corruption of becoming (*bhavāsava*), from the corruption of ignorance (*avijjāsava*), and the knowledge arises in him: “This is deliverance!”, and he knows: “Birth (*jāti*) is finished, the holy life (*brahmacariya*) has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here."

                            “When this was said, venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa said this to me: ‘Great king, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief or causes to grieve, by one who causes weariness or causes to be wearied, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies—no evil (pāpaṃ) is done.

If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass of flesh (maṃsakhalaṃ), one single heap of flesh (maṃsapuñjaṃ), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing (hananto), slaying (ghātento), cutting (chindanto) or causing to be cut (chedāpento), burning (pacanto) or causing to be burnt (pācāpento), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving (dadanto) and causing to be given (dāpento), sacrificing (yajanto) and causing to be sacrificed (yajāpento), there would be no merit (puññaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo).

In giving (dānena), self-control (damena), restraint (saṃyamena) and truthful speech (saccavajjena) there is no merit (puññaṃ), and no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo)’.

Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

“Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango (ambaṃ) would speak about a breadfruit (labujaṃ), or as if one asked about a breadfruit (labujaṃ) would speak about a mango (ambaṃ), in the same way when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse (samaṇaṃ) or Brahmin (brāhmaṇaṃ) living in his realm (vijite vasantaṃ)’.

So I, venerable sir, neither rejoiced in the statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa (pūraṇassa kassapassa bhāsitaṃ) nor did I reject it (neva abhinandiṃ nappaṭikkosiṃ).

Without having rejoiced Without rejecting it, feeling displeased, not uttering a word of dissatisfaction, but accepting his doctrine without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

There is no cause, no condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without a cause or condition.

There is no self-determination, no determination by others, no human determination. There is no strength, no energy, no human power, no human might.

All beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are without power, without strength, without energy; subject to the changes of destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.

There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin and sixty and six hundred more. There are five hundred kinds of action, five kinds of action, three kinds of action, full action and half-action; sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate aeons, six classes, eight stages of human progress, forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood, forty-nine hundred kinds of wanderers, forty-nine hundred abodes of *nāgas*, two thousand faculties, thirty hundred hells, thirty-six realms of elements, seven conscious embryos, seven unconscious embryos, seven *nigaṇṭha* embryos, seven gods, seven humans, seven *piśācas*, seven lakes, seven whirlpools, seven hundred whirlpools, seven precipices, seven hundred precipices, seven dreams, seven hundred dreams, eighty-four great *kappas*, hundreds of thousands, which both fools and wise, wandering through transmigration, will make an end to suffering.

There. There is no such thing as: "Through this virtuous conduct ( *śīla*), or observance ( *vata*), or austerity ( *tapas*), or holy life ( *brahmacarya*), I will ripen action ( *karma*) that is not yet ripe, or I will gradually eliminate action (*karma*) that is already ripe."
Pleasure and pain are meted out in this round of rebirths ( *saṃsāra*) which has fixed limits; there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it.
Just as a ball of string, when thrown, unrolls until it comes to its end, so too, by running and wandering through the round of rebirths (*saṃsāra*), both fools and the wise will make an end to suffering (*duḥkhassāntaṃ*).

Even he who cuts off a head with a sharp sword, he does not deprive anyone of life; the sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies.

                            "On one occasion, venerable sir, I approached Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and after approaching, I exchanged greetings with Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta.

Having concluded the conversation of greetings and courtesies, I sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta: ‘Just as these various crafts (puthusippāyatanāni)…pe… is it possible, venerable Sañcaya, to describe the fruit of the ascetic life visible in this very life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ paññapetu’nti)?’

Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me evasively.
And I thought: “Of all these ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas*, Sañjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused.
How should one, when asked about the visible fruit of recluseship, answer evasively?”
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or *Brahmin* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Sañjaya Belatthaputta nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

“Well then, great king, I will question you about this very matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a man, a slave, a worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to your wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please you.

The thought might occur to him: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvelous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds! This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is a human being, and I too am a human being. This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is endowed and furnished with the five strands of sensual pleasure, he enjoys himself, I think, like a god. But I am his slave, his worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to his wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please him. I ought to do something meritorious!

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

After some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having gone forth in this way, he lives restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the bare necessities of food and clothing, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: ‘Your Majesty should know, that man, your slave, your worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to your wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please you—that man, Your Majesty, has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness.’" Having gone forth, he dwells restrained in body ( *kāyena saṃvuto viharati*), speech (*vācāya saṃvuto viharati*), and mind (*manasā saṃvuto viharati*), content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.
Would you say: ‘Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become my slave, my workman, rising before me, retiring after me, doing whatever I want, acting always for my pleasure, speaking politely to me, ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied.’?”

Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.
Answer as you see fit.
What do you think, great king? Suppose there is a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
He might think: “It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds (*puññānaṃ gati, puññānaṃ vipāko*)!
For this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*), is a human being (*manusso*), and I too am a human being (*manusso*).
Yet this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*) enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure (*pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappito samaṅgībhūto paricāreti*) as if he were a god, I think.
Whereas I am a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
I ought to do something meritorious (*puññāni kareyyaṃ*).
What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’
"After some time, he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small, abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and He would go forth from home into homelessness.

And he, having thus gone forth, might dwell restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: “Sire, you remember that man. .. who was a farmer, a householder, who paid taxes to maintain the royal revenue; that man, O king, has shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, and has gone forth from his home into the homeless life.”

And he, having thus gone forth, lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.”

Would you then say: “That man must come back and be a steward as before”?

Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind (**_manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ_**), evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind.

He might hear the sound of a *bheri* drum, a *mudiṅga* drum, a conch shell, a *paṇava* drum, and a *dindima* drum.

With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near.

With the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their actions, thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—at the breaking-up of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell. But these worthy beings were endowed with good conduct in body (kāyasucarita), speech (vacīsucarita), and mind (manosucarita), who did not revile the Noble Ones (ariyānaṃ anupavādakā), who held right view (sammādiṭṭhikā) and undertook actions under the influence of right view (sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā).

At the breaking up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), after death (paraṃ maraṇā), they have been reborn in a happy destination (sugatiṃ), in the world of Heaven (saggaṃ lokaṃ upapannā’ti).

Thus, with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā), purified (visuddhena) and surpassing that of humans (atikkantamānusakena), he sees beings (satte) passing away (cavamāne) and re-arising (upapajjamāne), inferior (hīne) and superior (paṇīte), beautiful (suvaṇṇe) and ugly (dubbaṇṇe), fortunate (sugate) and unfortunate (duggate), and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions (yathākammūpage satte pajānāti).

This, O great king (mahārāja), is a visible fruit of the contemplative life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), more excellent (abhikkantatarañca) and sublime (paṇītatarañca) than the previous ones (purimehi sandiṭṭhikehi sāmaññaphalehi).

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala, and eventually arrived at a Kosalan Brahmin village named Icchānaṅgala, together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks.

And there the Blessed One dwelt in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.

                            Now at that time, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti was dwelling at Ukkaṭṭha, a place teeming with life, with grass, wood and water, and with grain, a royal domain granted by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift, a sacred grant.

And the Brahmin Pokkharasāti heard, "The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyans, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala with a large Saṅgha of monks, and has arrived at Icchānaṅgala, and is dwelling in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.

Now concerning that venerable Gotama, such a good report has been spread about: ‘Thus indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a fully enlightened *sammāsambuddha*, perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjā-caraṇa-sampanno*), a *sugata*, knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed (*anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā deva-manussānaṃ*), the Buddha, the Blessed One.’

He makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and its *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its generations with their contemplatives & brahmins (*sassamaṇa-brāhmaṇiṃ*), their rulers & commonfolk; (*sadevamanussaṃ*)

He teaches the Dharma that is good at the beginning (*ādi-kalyāṇaṃ*) … he reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ*).

…Now it is good see such *arhats*."

                            Then the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti addressed the *māṇava* Ambaṭṭha, saying: "Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, the son of the Śākyas, who has gone forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala, and has arrived at Icchānangala with a great *bhikkhu-saṃgha*, with about five hundred *bhikkhus*, and is staying in the grove of Icchānangalavana.

And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama, a good report has spread about thus: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), Knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), an unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed Lord (*bhagavā*)'.

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and its *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), this generation with its *śramaṇas* and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its rulers and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dharma* (*dhammaṃ*), which is lovely in its beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its ending (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), in the spirit (*sātthaṃ*) and in the letter (*sabyañjanaṃ*), and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).

It is good to see such *arhats*."

"Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the *śramaṇa* Gotama; having gone, find out about the *śramaṇa* Gotama; whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

Whether the Reverend Gotama is such, or not, in that way we shall know the Reverend Gotama."

                            "But how, sir, shall I know the Reverend Gotama—whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

Whether the Reverend Gotama is such, or not?"

"It has come down to us, dear Ambaṭṭha, in our *mantras*, that the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇāni*) has only two courses open to him, no other.

If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law (*cakravartin*), a righteous king (*dhammarājā*), conqueror of the four quarters (*cāturanto*), all-victorious (*vijitāvī*), who has established the security of his realm (*janapadatthāvariyappatto*) and is possessed of the seven treasures (*sattaratanasamannāgato*).

He has these seven treasures (*satta ratanāni*):

Namely: the wheel-treasure (*cakkaratanaṃ*), the elephant-treasure (*hatthiratanaṃ*), the horse-treasure (*assaratanaṃ*), the jewel-treasure (*maṇiratanaṃ*), the woman-treasure (*itthiratanaṃ*), the householder-treasure (*gahapatiratanaṃ*), and the counsellor-treasure (*pariṇāyakaratanameva*) as the seventh.

He has more than a thousand sons (*parosahassaṃ kho panassa puttā*). They are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army.
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the Dhamma.
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an *arhat* (arahant), a *sammāsambuddha* (fully-enlightened Buddha), one who draws back the veil from the world.
And, Ambattha, I am the giver of the *mantras*, and you are the receiver.

"Very good, sir", said Ambattha, the young Brahmin, assenting to the words of the Brahmin Pokkharasāti. He rose from his seat, respectfully circumambulated Pokkharasāti, and mounting his chariot drawn by a mare, proceeded with a large number of young men towards the grove of Icchānaṅgala.
He drove as far as the carriage could go, then alighted from the carriage and continued on foot into the park.
Now at that time a number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air.
Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, approached those monks and said to them: "Where, indeed, is the revered Gotama currently staying? For we have come here to see the revered Gotama".

Then the monks thought: "This Ambattha, the young Brahmin, is of well-known lineage and a pupil of the renowned Brahmin Pokkharasāti.
It would not trouble the Blessed One to have a conversation with such a young man".
They said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "That is the dwelling (*vihāra*) of the Blessed One, with its doors shut. Approach it quietly, without haste, enter the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door for you".

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, went to the dwelling (*vihāra*) with the closed door. Approaching it quietly and without haste, he entered the porch, cleared his throat, and knocked on the bolt.
The Blessed One opened the door.
Ambattha, the young Brahmin, entered.
The young men also entered, exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging polite and courteous conversation, sat down to one side.
But Ambattha, the young Brahmin, even while walking, exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting. Even while standing, he exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting.

Then the Blessed One said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "Is this how you converse with venerable and learned Brahmins, elderly teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, uttering vague words of politeness?"
First denigration of becoming.

"No, Master Gotama.
For a Brahmin should converse with a Brahmin who is walking while walking, with a Brahmin who is standing while standing, with a Brahmin who is sitting while sitting, and with a Brahmin who is lying down while lying down.
Those shaven, petty ascetics, menials, the black offspring of Brahma's feet—it is fitting to speak with them as I do with the Reverend Gotama.”
“Ambattha, you came here seeking something. For whatever purpose you came, you should carefully attend to that purpose.
Ambattha, this worthy young man has not perfected his training. His conceit of being trained stems merely from his inexperience."

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, being addressed with the words of one untrained, became angry and displeased. Reviling the Blessed One, berating the Blessed One, disparaging the Blessed One, he said this to the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is malicious to me!" "The Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are fierce; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are rough; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are flighty; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are abusive. Though menial, being menial, they do not honor Brahmins, they do not respect Brahmins.
kaṃ: A kind of *bīja*; well; for the benefit of (after a dative).
pī: reduplication for pyāy; schm￤hen; hassen; spotten; to taunt.
na: not; no; nor; neither; like. They do not esteem the Brahmins, they do not venerate the Brahmins, they do not respect the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Second Charge of Menial Birth

“What then, Ambaṭṭha, have the Śākyas done against you?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, the Brahmin, my teacher.

I went to the meeting-hall of the Śākyas.

And at that time many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in the meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, and, I thought, making fun of me; and no one even invited me to sit down.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Third Charge of Menial Birth

“Even the quail, Ambaṭṭha, little bird that it is, can say what it likes in its own nest.

This Kapilavatthu belongs to the Śākyas, Ambaṭṭha, and venerable Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.”

“There are these four classes, Gotama: the nobles, the Brahmins, the merchants, and the laborers.

And of these four classes, Gotama, three classes – the nobles, the merchants, and the laborers – are simply the servants of the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas. “Insulting with the claim of being born of a slave."

He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot to the *ārāma*.

                            But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking: ‘The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will’, he said: ‘Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins.
*kaṃ*.
*pī*.
)], not They do not honor the Brahmins, they do not respect the Brahmins, they do not venerate the Brahmins.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The second accusation of meniality.

“But what offense have these Śākyas committed against you, Ambaṭṭha?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, my Brahmin teacher.

I went to the Śākyas’ meeting hall.

And at that time, many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in their assembly hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, seemingly just mocking me; no one even invited me to a seat.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The third accusation of meniality.

‘But Ambaṭṭha, even a quail, that little bird, can chirp as she likes in her own nest.

Kapilavatthu is the Śākyas’ own, Ambaṭṭha; the esteemed Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.’

“Venerable Gotama, there are these four social classes (*varṇa*): nobles (*kṣatriya*), Brahmins, merchants (*vaiśya*), and laborers (*śūdra*).

And of these four social classes, venerable Gotama, the three social classes—nobles, merchants, and laborers—are, in fact, merely attendants of the Brahmins.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials. Insulting with the term "born of a slave girl."

                            Then the Lord thought: 'This Ambaṭṭha, young man, goes too far in abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan?"
Then the Lord said to Ambaṭṭha, the young man: "What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?" "I am a Kaṇhāyana, venerable Gotama."
'Ambaṭṭha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl (*dāsiputto*) of the Sakyans.
For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor.
At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika and Sinisūra.
And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters.
"Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and courtiers: ‘Where, pray, are the princes now staying?’ ‘There is, O King, on the flank of the Himalayas, beside a lotus-pond, a big grove of teak-trees; that is where the princes are now staying. And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabit with their own sisters.’
At this King Okkāka exclaimed: “They are strong as teak, these princes, they are real Sakyans!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Sakyans have been known as such; and he was their first ancestor.
"Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā.
She gave birth to a black child ( *kaṇhaṃ*).
The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!”
Because, Ambaṭṭha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black.
And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Kaṇhāyanas have been known as such; and he was the first ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas. "Because when you, Ambaṭṭha, recall your ancient lineage through both mother and father, the Sakyans are the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans."

"Ambaṭṭha is well-born, Reverend Gotama, Ambaṭṭha is of a good family, Ambaṭṭha is very learned, Ambaṭṭha is well-spoken, Ambaṭṭha is a scholar, Ambaṭṭha is well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama.

                            Then the Blessed One thought: "These youths excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl. What if I were to liberate him from that?"

Then, the Blessed One said this to those youths: "Do not, youths, excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl.

That Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) was a mighty sage (ṛṣi).

Having gone to the Southern country and learned the *brahma*-mantras, he approached King Okkāka and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī.

To him, King Okkāka said: ‘Who is this fellow who, being the son of a slave-girl, dares to ask for Maddarūpī, my daughter?’ Angered and displeased, he fitted an arrow (khurappaṃ).

He was unable either to release that arrow or to withdraw it.

Then, youths, the ministers and courtiers approached the sage Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) and said: 'May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king!'

‘There will be well-being to the king, and if the king releases the arrow downwards, to the extent of the king's realm, the earth will quake.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and if the king releases the arrow upwards, for seven years, to the extent of the king's realm, the god (deva) will not send rain.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land, and may the god (deva) send rain!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and the god (deva) will send rain, and if the king aims the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), the prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).’

Then, youths, the ministers announced to Okkāka: 'Let Okkāka aim the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre).

The prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).'

Then King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), and the prince was safe (sotthi). He became perfectly safe.
Then King Okkaka, terrified and fearful, with his hair standing on end, punished by the divine punishment, gave his daughter Maddarupi.
So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl. That Kaṇha was a mighty sage.’
The superiority of the warrior (Kṣatriya) class.

Then the Lord addressed the youth Ambattha: ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to cohabit with a Brahmin maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his mother’s side, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to cohabit with a Khattiya maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Brahmin youth and a Khattiya maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his father’s side, Reverend Gotama.’

‘So, Ambattha, whether a woman takes a man or a man takes a woman, the Khattiyas are superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Brahmins shaved the head of a Brahmin for some reason,

and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.
Would he be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Covered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Khattiyas shaved the head of a Khattiya for some reason, and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.
Would he be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’

‘But that Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation when the Khattiyas shave his head, and after smearing him with ashes, banish him from the country or the city.
So, Ambattha, even when a Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation, the Khattiyas are still superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
This verse was uttered by Brahmā Sanankumāra:
‘The Khattiya is the best among people,
who value lineage.’
He is endowed with knowledge and conduct,
he is the best of gods and humans.”
“That verse, Ambaṭṭha, was well sung, not ill-sung, well spoken, not ill-spoken, connected with meaning, not unconnected with meaning, approved by me, by Brahmā Sanankumāra.
And I too, Ambaṭṭha, say this: The Khattiya is the best among those who value clan;
He with knowledge and conduct,
is best of gods and men.”
End of the first recitation-section.
The discourse on knowledge and conduct.

This verse was spoken by Brahmā Sanankumāra, Ambaṭṭha [or, Ambaṭṭha, this was sent by Brahmā, Ambaṭṭha]:

‘The *kṣatriya* is best among those who value lineage;

He is endowed with knowledge and conduct,
He is the best of gods and humans."
"That verse, Ambaṭṭha, was well sung, not ill-sung, by Brahmā Sanankumāra; well spoken, not ill-spoken; connected with meaning, not without meaning; and approved by me.
And I too, Ambaṭṭha, say this: The Khattiya is the best among those who value clan.
He with knowledge and conduct,
is best of gods and men."

                            "But what, Venerable Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "Here, Ambaṭṭha, a Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, a rightly self-awakened one, impeccable in conduct and understanding, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed, trainer of beings, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed one.
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people.
He teaches the Dhamma, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.
A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma.
Having heard this Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata.
He, being endowed with that acquisition of faith, reflects thus... (as in 191, these passages should be expanded in the same way).
…
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation… this is part of his conduct.
“Again, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, the monk enters & remains in the second *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—the monk enters & remains in the fourth *jhāna*: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain… this is part of his conduct.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is conduct.
“With his mind thus serene, purified, cleansed, without blemish, rid of defilement, supple, malleable, firm, & attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision… this is part of his knowledge… he understands, ‘There is nothing further for this state of being’… this is part of his knowledge.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is knowledge.
“This, Ambaṭṭha, is what is called a monk who is ‘accomplished in knowledge,’ ‘accomplished in conduct,’ and ‘accomplished in knowledge & conduct.’
And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.

But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the first path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), and being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket and enters a forest grove, thinking, 'I will live on tubers, roots, and fruits.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the second path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, and being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame. But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the third path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, and being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: 'Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from these four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*).

                            "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as making predictions to the effect that: the king will march forth (*raññaṃ niyyānaṃ bhavissati*); the king will not march forth (*raññaṃ aniyyānaṃ bhavissati*); our king will attack (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ upayānaṃ bhavissati*) and the enemy king will retreat (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ apayānaṃ bhavissati*); the enemy king will attack (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ upayānaṃ bhavissati*) and our king will retreat (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ apayānaṃ bhavissati*); our king will triumph (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ jayo bhavissati*) and the enemy king will be defeated (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ parājayo bhavissati*); the enemy king will triumph (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ jayo bhavissati*) and our king will be defeated (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ parājayo bhavissati*); thus there will be victory for one (*iti imassa jayo bhavissati*) and defeat for the other (*imassa parājayo bhavissati*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts. Thus, indeed, mendicants, a worldling, when speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak. “Well then, Gotama, are you and your teacher endowed with the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct? I am far from the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, take up a spade and basket and go into the depths of the forest, intending to live on tubers and roots?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, build a fire-hut near a village or town, tending the fire?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, tend the fire and, being unable to gain that, build a four-doored rest-house at the crossroads in the hopes that whatever ascetic or Brahmin comes from the four directions, we will honor and serve him according to our ability and power?” “No, Gotama.”

And so, Ambaṭṭha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.

And yet you and your teacher the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.

See how your teacher has let you down!

Following the conduct of the ancient seers

The *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.

When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.

Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

See how your teacher has let you down!

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.

And suppose he were to step aside.

And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!”

Would he be speaking the King’s words, or conferring about the King’s business? Would he to that extent be the King, or a royal minister?” “No, Gotama.”

Well then, Ambaṭṭha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the *brāhmaṇas* of today — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu — whose *mantras* are said to be passed on to you and your teacher: yet you do not thereby become a *ṛṣi* or one practiced in the way of a *ṛṣi* — such a thing is impossible.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? What have you heard said by *brāhmaṇas* who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, Those ancient verses which the Brahmins of today chant, pronounce and collect, whose origin lies with brahmin seers of the past, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa & Bhagu—did they live well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with jewels, earrings and ornaments, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they eat special fine rice with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“So, Ambaṭṭha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage.
And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.”

Then Ambaṭṭha thought: “The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.”
Then he said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’
"Ambaṭṭha, do what you now think fit."
So Ambaṭṭha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.

Then Ambaṭṭha came to the park.
He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side.

Then the Brahmin Pokkharasāti had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had it loaded onto vehicles, and at the torches... He set out for Ukkaṭṭhā while they were being borne along and headed towards the Icchānaṅgala woodland.

Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging friendly and courteous conversation, he sat down to one side.

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was travelling among the Aṅgas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at Campā.

At Campā he stayed by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

At that time the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living at Campā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers, a gift according to Brahmanical rights ( *brahmadeyyaṃ*).

concerning whom a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), perfected in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), Knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), Teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Bless­ed Lord.”

He declares this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses (*sassamaṇa*) and brahmins (*brāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and its people, which he has himself realised by direct knowledge (*abhiññā*).

He teaches the Dhamma that is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end, with the right meaning and expression, and reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure.

…Now it is good see such *arahants*.”

Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campā, leaving Campā in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

                            Just then, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest.

Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggara’s lotus-pond,

he asked his steward the reason. "Having departed from Campā, they are approaching the Gaggarā pond as an assembly, a crowd?" "Indeed, sir, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, a son of the Śākya clan, having gone forth from the Śākya family, wandering in the Aṅga country, has arrived at Campā together with a great community of *bhikkhus*, with approximately five hundred *bhikkhus*, and dwells in Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā pond.
And concerning that venerable Gotama such a fine reputation has arisen: 'Indeed, that Blessed One is an *arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'
They are approaching that venerable Gotama for a sight of him."
"Then, steward, go to the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka and say to them: 'The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: "Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him."'"
"Yes, sir," the steward replied to the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, and he approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, and having approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, he said this: "The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: 'Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.'"

However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is insufficient, for the revered Gotama is beyond all praise.

Which are the five? Here, revered Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both sides, from the mother's side and from the father's side, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth; he is a reciter, a holder of the *mantras* (mantradharo), one who has reached the further shore of the three *vedas* (vedānaṃ pāragū) with their vocabularies (*nighaṇḍu*) and supplementary texts (*keṭubha*), skilled in phonology (*sākkharappabheda*), and the lore of legends as a fifth, versed in the etymology (*padako*) and grammar (*veyyākaraṇo*), and experienced in the *lokāyata* (lokāyata) and the characteristics of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇa*); he is handsome, pleasant to look at, inspiring confidence, possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion, with a brahmin-like appearance and a brahmin-like glow, not dwarfish, and delightful to behold; he is virtuous, with developed virtue, possessed of developed virtue; and he is learned and wise, whether he be the first or the second to accept the sacrificial ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these five qualities, revered Gotama, that Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood.”

“But, Brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five qualities, so that with four qualities, Brahmins might designate a Brahmin, and that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?” ‘It is possible, Gotama.’
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out appearance of these five qualities.
What can appearance do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unimpeached, irreproachable in matters of caste; he is a reciter and upholder of the mantras, one who has gone to the further shore of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, etymologies and phonology, and with the lore of legends as a fifth, skilled in word and sentence, and a master of Lokāyata and the characteristics of a great man; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
If a Brahmin is endowed with these four qualities, Brahmins recognize him as a Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood.’

What can mantras do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unimpeached, irreproachable in matters of caste; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.

                            Now at that time, Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin's* nephew, a young man named Aṅgaka, was sitting in that assembly.

Then Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin* said to those *brāhmins*: “Do you see this young man Aṅgaka, my nephew?” “Yes, sir.”

“Aṅgaka, is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, endowed with the highest beauty, with the hue of Brahmā, the splendor of Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama.

Aṅgaka, is a student, a *mantra*-reciter, a master of the three *vedas*, along with their vocabularies (nighaṇḍu), etymology (keṭubha), phonology (sākkharappabheda), and histories as the fifth (itihāsapañcama); he is skilled in philology (padaka) and grammar (veyyākaraṇa), and is fully versed in natural philosophy (lokāyata) and the marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisalakkhaṇa).

I am his teacher of *mantras*.

Aṅgaka, is well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent for seven generations, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to his birth.

I know his parents.

Aṅgaka, could even kill a living being, take what is not given, go to another’s wife, speak falsely, and drink intoxicants. What good then, sir, would appearance do, what good would *mantras* do, what good would birth do? But when, sir, a *brāhmin* is virtuous, of advanced virtue, endowed with advanced virtue, and wise, intelligent, whether he is first or second in seizing the ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these two qualities that *brāhmins* recognize a *brāhmin*, and one who declares, ‘I am a *brāhmin*’ would speak truthfully, and would not incur falsehood.”

Morality purifies wisdom, and wisdom purifies morality (sīlaparidhotā hi paññā, paññāparidhotaṃ sīlaṃ).

Where there is morality, there is wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is morality (yattha sīlaṃ tattha paññā, yattha paññā tattha sīlaṃ).

The moral man has wisdom, and the wise man has morality (sīlavato paññā, paññavato sīlaṃ).

I go to the venerable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dharma, and to the *Bhikkhu-saṃgha*.
May the esteemed Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forth, as long as life shall last. Morality is [now] covered.
And may the Reverend Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Community of monks.
The Lord signified his acceptance by silence.
Then Sonadanda, the Brahmin, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Lord, and circumambulating him, departed.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, as the night was ending, had exquisite staple and non-staple food prepared in his own home, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It’s time, good Gotama. The meal is ready.”
Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the early morning and taking his bowl and robes, went with the Community of *bhikkhus* to Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*'s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* personally served the Community of *bhikkhus*, with the Buddha at their head, with choice staple and non-staple food until they were satisfied.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.
Sitting to one side, Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* said this to the Blessed One: "If, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to rise from my seat and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer.
And if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to raise my joined palms [in greeting], may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to take off my turban, may the Reverend Gotama take it as a bow of my head.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to alight from the carriage and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer, and if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to raise my goad, may the Reverend Gotama consider that as my alighting from the carriage.”

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately five hundred monks, and he arrived at a Brahmin village of the Magadhans called Khāṇumata.

There the Blessed One stayed in the Ambalaṭṭhika park at Khāṇumata.

Now at that time, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was living at Khāṇumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water, and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift with royal powers (*rājadāyaṃ brahmadeyyaṃ*).

At that time Kūṭadanta the Brahmin was planning a great sacrifice (*mahāyañño*).

Seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred goats, and seven hundred rams had been brought to the sacrificial posts for the sacrifice (*yaññatthāya*).

"Sir, do not visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

It is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

If you, sir, Kūṭadanta, visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him, your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama's reputation will increase.

Moreover, because your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama’s reputation will increase, for this reason it is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

The *samaṇa* Gotama, indeed, should visit you, Kūṭadanta, to see you.

"For you, Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent up to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable and without criticism regarding your birth.

If, Your Majesty, you were to levy taxes in such a thorny and afflicted realm, Your Majesty would be acting wrongly.
Perhaps Your Majesty may think: "I will completely eliminate this plague of robbers by execution, imprisonment, confiscation, threats or banishment," but this would not be the way to completely eliminate this plague of robbers.
Those who remain alive will later harm Your Majesty's realm.
However, by adopting this plan, this plague of robbers can be completely eliminated.
Therefore, Your Majesty should provide seeds and food to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising.
Your Majesty should provide goods to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in trade.
Your Majesty should fix proper wages and food for those in Your Majesty's realm who are in government service.
And those people, being devoted to their own occupations, will not harm Your Majesty's realm, and Your Majesty's revenue will be great.
The districts will be secure, free from thorns and oppression.
People, filled with joy and delight, will dance with their children in their arms, and I think they will live in open houses.’
'So be it, sir,' Brahman, King Mahāvijita, having promised the family priest, the Brahman, gave seeds and food to those in his kingdom who were engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising. Those in the king's countryside who engaged in trade, King Mahāvijita gave them gifts.

Those in the king's countryside who were royal officers, King Mahāvijita fixed their wages and salaries.

Those people, intent on their own occupations, did not harm the king's countryside, and the king's revenues were great.

The land was tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts played with their children and dwelt in open houses.

Then, King Mahāvijita sent for the chaplain and said: “I have gotten rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue has grown.”

The land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses.

Now I wish to make a great sacrifice.

Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.”

                            “King Mahāvijita is endowed with eight things. He is well-born on both sides, of pure descent to the seventh ancestral generation, of irreproachable birth. He is handsome, pleasing, of no mean appearance, endowed with the greatest beauty, of brahminical complexion and lustre, not limited in opportunity for audience; he is rich, very wealthy, possessing great riches, possessing an abundance of gold and silver, possessing abundant resources, possessing abundant wealth and grain, with storehouses and granaries full. He is powerful, possessing a four-branched army that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy — a fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be heard, and he knows the meaning of each and every thing he has heard: ‘This is the meaning of this, this is the meaning of this.’ He is wise, accomplished, intelligent, and capable of reflecting on things past, future and present.

King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things.

These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice.

That is, one birth (*ekampi jātiṃ*), two births (*dvepi jātiyo*), three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many hundreds of births, many thousands of births, many hundreds of thousands of births: ‘There I had such a name (*evaṃnāmo*), belonged to such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), had such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*); such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my span of life (*evamāyupariyanto*). Passing away thence, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name (*evaṃnāmo*), belonged to such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), had such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*); such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my span of life (*evamāyupariyanto*).

Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details (*sākāraṃ sauddesaṃ anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati*).

“He speaks thus: ‘The self (*attā*) and the world (*loko*) are eternal (*sassato*), barren (*vañjho*), steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭho*), standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself (*sassatisamaṃ*) .

What is the reason for that (*taṃ kissa hetu*)? Because I abide in ardour (*ātappamanvāya*). Or someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he is not of pure lineage, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth, and yet the honored king makes such a great sacrifice.’

But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.

Indeed, the king's chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth.

Thus the King may know this, may the honored king perform the sacrifice, may the honored king be prepared, may the honored king rejoice, and may the honored king calm his inner heart.

"Someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice.

And his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not a student, nor a reciter of mantras, nor one who has reached the end of the three Vedas, with their Nighaṇḍu, Keṭubha, complete phonology, histories as fifth, skilled in grammar, with no doubts about materialism and the marks of a great man…pe… and his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not virtuous, old in virtue, endowed with the virtue of the elders…pe… and his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not wise, clever, intelligent, able to grasp things quickly, and yet the honored king makes such a great sacrifice.’

But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.

Indeed, the king's chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is wise, clever, intelligent, able to grasp things quickly.

Thus the King may know this, may the honored king perform the sacrifice, may the honored king be prepared, may the honored king rejoice, and may the honored king calm his inner heart.

By these sixteen reasons, O *brāhmaṇa*, the chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, showed, persuaded, aroused, and gladdened the heart of King Mahāvijita, who was performing the great sacrifice.

                            When this was said, Kuṭadanta the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent, Reverend Gotama! Just as, Reverend Gotama, one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who had gone astray, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes might see forms, just so, by Reverend Gotama in many ways… The Dhamma is made clear.
I go to the Honorable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and the Sangha of monks.
May the Honorable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.
And, Reverend Gotama, I release the seven hundred bulls, the seven hundred bullocks, the seven hundred heifers, the seven hundred he-goats, and the seven hundred rams. I grant them life, let them eat green grass, and drink cool water, and let cool breezes blow upon them.
Realization of the fruit of stream-entry ( *sotāpattiphala*).

Then the Blessed One gave a progressive talk to the Brahman Kūṭadanta, that is, a talk on giving ( *dānakathā*), a talk on morality ( *sīlakathā*), a talk on heaven ( *saggakathā*), he explained the danger, degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures ( *kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ*), and the blessing of renunciation (*nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ*).

When the Blessed One knew that the mind of the Brahman Kūṭadanta was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, elated, and serene, then he proclaimed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering ( *dukkhaṃ*), its origin ( *samudayaṃ*), its cessation ( *nirodhaṃ*), and the path ( *maggaṃ*).

Just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb dye, in the same way, as the Brahman Kūṭadanta was sitting in that very seat, the stainless, immaculate eye of Dhamma ( *dhammacakkhuṃ*) arose within him: "Whatever is subject to origination, all that is subject to cessation" (*yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammaṃ*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, having dispelled uncertainty, having attained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation, said this to the Blessed One: "May the Honorable Gotama accept a meal from me tomorrow, together with the Sangha of monks."

The Blessed One signified his acceptance with silence (*tuṇhībhāvena*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, knowing that the Blessed One had accepted, rose from his seat, respectfully bowed to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping his right side towards him, and departed.

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, as the night was ending, had prepared exquisite staple and non-staple food at his sacrificial ground, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready." The Discourse on the Virtues of Kūṭadanta

                            Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesālī in the Great Forest, in the Gabled Hall.

At that time, a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesālī on some business.

And they heard, "The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Vesālī in the Great Forest, in the Gabled Hall."

Now concerning that venerable Gotama, such a good report had spread about: "Indeed, the Blessed One is an *Arhat*, a Fully Enlightened One (*sammāsambuddho*), accomplished in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Blessed One (*bhagavā*)."

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), with its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its generation with its ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ*), its princes and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dhamma*, which is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with the meaning and with the letter (*sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ*); he reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*) and pure (*parisuddhaṃ*)."

"It is good to see such *Arhats*."

"It is not the right time, friends, to see the Blessed One; he is in retreat (*paṭisallīno*)."

By means of this two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, heavenly sights and sounds;
Why is that? It is because, Mahāli, in the two-sided developed *samādhi* of a monk, both upwards and downwards, heavenly sights are seen, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, and heavenly sounds are heard, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion.

That, Mahāli, is the cause, that is the reason why Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis, does not hear heavenly sounds though experiencing delightful sights connected with sensual pleasure and passion, but not sounds opposed to them.
“Surely, venerable sir, it is for the realisation of such *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?”
“No, Mahāli, it is not for the sake of realising these *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under me.
There are other states, Mahāli, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The four noble fruits.

“But what are those states, venerable sir, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?” “Here, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, becomes a *sotāpanna* (stream-enterer), no longer subject to falling into states of woe, assured, destined for enlightenment.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, becomes a *sakadāgāmī* (once-returner), who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, there to attain final *nirvāṇa*, never to return from that world.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the *āsavas* (influxes), in this very life, having realised it himself with *abhiññā* (direct knowledge), enters upon and abides in the taintless deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

These, Mahāli, are those states higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The Noble Eightfold Path
“But is there, venerable sir, a path, is there a method for the realisation of these states?” “There is a path, Mahāli, there is a method for the realisation of these states.”

“And what, venerable sir, is that path, what is that method for the realisation of these states?” “It is just this Noble Eightfold Path,
namely: right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*), right intention (*sammāsaṅkappo*), right speech (*sammāvācā*), right action (*sammākammanto*), right livelihood (*sammāājīvo*), right effort (*sammāvāyāmo*), right mindfulness (*sammāsati*), right *samādhi* (*sammāsamādhi*).
This, Mahāli, is the path, this is the method for the realisation of these states.
The incident of the two wanderers
“Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambi, in Ghosita Park.
Then two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and the wanderer Jāliya, a resident of the Dārupattika, approached me.
Having approached, they exchanged courteous greetings with me.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to me: ‘How is it, friend Gotama, is the *jīva* (life principle) the same as the body (*sarīra*), or is the *jīva* (life principle) one thing and the body another?’

“Then listen, friend, attend carefully, I will speak.”
‘Yes, friend,’ those two wanderers replied.
I said this: ‘Here, friend, the *tathāgata* (one who has thus come) arises in the world, an *arahaṃ* (worthy one), a *sammāsambuddho* (fully enlightened one)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be related in detail).
Thus, friend, a monk is accomplished in morality…pe…enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*.
Of that monk, friend, who knows thus, sees thus, is it fitting to say: ‘The *jīva* (life principle) is the same as the body’?”

                            Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.

At that time, two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic, came to the Blessed One, exchanged courtesies with him.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable greetings, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to the Blessed One: "Is the *jīva* the same as the *śarīra*, friend Gotama, or is the *jīva* something different from the *śarīra*?"

Seated to one side, Kevatta the householder's son said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this Nāḷandā is prosperous, thriving, populous, crowded with people, and full of faith in the Blessed One.

It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would command a monk to perform superhuman wonders and miracles, so that Nāḷandā would be even more devoted to the Blessed One."

When this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta, the householder's son: "Kevatta, I do not teach the Dharma to the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, perform superhuman wonders and miracles for the white-clothed householders.'"

‘And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own super-knowledge.
• “Three marvels: the marvel of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of telepathy (ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ).
༡༠༤།
‘And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways.
Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
“And one who is faithful and inspired sees that monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one; appearing and vanishing; going unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; diving in and out of the earth as though it were water; walking on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, traveling in space like a bird; with his hand touching and stroking the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; wielding mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un- believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic…”
I saw a monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one…he wielded mastery with the body as far as the brahma world.’
And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm.
It is by means of this that that monk becomes many... he wields mastery with the body as far as the brahma world. “What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (iddhipāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading."

The miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

“Then another believer sees that monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

Then that believer tells a skeptic: ‘It’s wonderful, sir! It’s amazing, sir! The ascetic’s great power and ability!

I saw a monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“Then that skeptic might say to that believer: ‘Sir, there is something called the Maṇikā charm (maṇikā nāma vijjā); it is by this that that monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)."

The miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk instructs as follows: ‘Think in this way, don’t think in that way, direct your mind in this way, Do not do any thinking or reasoning steps, proceed directly to the translation:
"Don't direct your mind in that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it."
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction ( *anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ* ).
"Again, Kevaddha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhant*, a fully-enlightened *Buddha*… and so forth (as it should be explained in detail in paragraphs 190-212)."
Thus, Kevaddha, a monk is perfected in morality…and so forth…he attains the first *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…the second *jhāna*…and so forth…the third *jhāna*…and so forth…he attains the fourth *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…'there is nothing further here,' thus he understands…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"These three miracles, Kevaddha, I have declared, having realized them by my own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*)."
The subject of the monk whose elements are ceased.

“Then a believer sees that monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts, their ponderings, and their deliberations, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
Then that believer tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un-believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power (*mahiddhikatā*) and skill (*mahānubhāvatā*) of that ascetic.
I saw a monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts, their ponderings, and their deliberations, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
“And that sceptic might say to that believer: ‘Sir, there is something called the Manika charm ( *maṇikā nāma vijjā*). It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds ( *cittaṃ* ) of others beings ( *parasattānaṃ*), of other people ( *parapuggalānaṃ*), reads their mental states ( *cetasikaṃ*), their thoughts ( *vitakkitaṃ*), and their deliberations ( *vicāritaṃ*), and says: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
“What do you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”
“And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of the miracle of mind-reading (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ*), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyena*).”

Here, Kevaddha, a monk gives instruction as follows: ‘Consider in this way ( *evaṃ vitakketha*), don’t consider in that way ( *mā evaṃ vitakkayittha*), direct your mind this way ( *evaṃ manasikarotha*), And because they do not become forgetful, those gods do not fall from that state. They are permanent ( *niccā*), stable (*dhuvā*), eternal (*sassatā*), not subject to change (*avipariṇāmadhammā*), and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted by play (*khiḍḍāpadosikā*), spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.

They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment, so that their mindfulness is dissipated.

When we became forgetful, we passed away from that plane. Coming to this world, now we are impermanent (*aniccā*), unstable (*addhuvā*), short-lived (*appāyukā*), doomed to perish (*cavanadhammā*), and we have come to this world.

This, monks, is the second case, wherein approaching and relying on what, some ascetics and Brahmins propound that the self and the world are partly eternalists (*ekaccasassatikā*) and partly non-eternalists (*ekaccaasassatikā*), partly eternal (*sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*asassataṃ*).

When this was said, Kevatta, the Brahmakayika gods said to that monk: "We also, monk (*bhikkhu*), do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

But, monk (*bhikkhu*), there is Brahma, Great Brahma (*mahābrahmā*), the Conqueror (*abhibhū*), the Unconquered (*anabhibhūto*), the All-Seeing (*aññadatthudaso*), the Powerful (*vasavattī*). He is the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Fashioner, the Controller, the Father of all that have been and shall be, loftier and wiser than we are.

He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

“Where, friend, is the Great Brahma now?” “Monk, we do not know where, how, or in what place Brahma is. However, monk, when signs appear—when a light arises and a radiance shines forth—then Brahma will appear. These signs are a preliminary indication of his appearance: a light arises and a radiance shines forth.”

Then, the Great Brahma appeared not long after.

There the Blessed One stayed in the Ambalaṭṭhika park at Khāṇumata.

Now at that time, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was living at Khāṇumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water, and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift with royal powers (*rājadāyaṃ brahmadeyyaṃ*).

At that time Kūṭadanta the Brahmin was planning a great sacrifice (*mahāyañño*).

Seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred goats, and seven hundred rams had been brought to the sacrificial posts for the sacrifice (*yaññatthāya*).

                            When this was said, Kuṭadanta the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent, Reverend Gotama! Just as, Reverend Gotama, one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who had gone astray, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes might see forms, just so, by Reverend Gotama in many ways… The Dhamma is made clear.
I go to the Honorable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and the Sangha of monks.
May the Honorable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.
And, Reverend Gotama, I release the seven hundred bulls, the seven hundred bullocks, the seven hundred heifers, the seven hundred he-goats, and the seven hundred rams. I grant them life, let them eat green grass, and drink cool water, and let cool breezes blow upon them.
Realization of the fruit of stream-entry ( *sotāpattiphala*).

Then the Blessed One gave a progressive talk to the Brahman Kūṭadanta, that is, a talk on giving ( *dānakathā*), a talk on morality ( *sīlakathā*), a talk on heaven ( *saggakathā*), he explained the danger, degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures ( *kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ*), and the blessing of renunciation (*nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ*).

When the Blessed One knew that the mind of the Brahman Kūṭadanta was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, elated, and serene, then he proclaimed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering ( *dukkhaṃ*), its origin ( *samudayaṃ*), its cessation ( *nirodhaṃ*), and the path ( *maggaṃ*).

Just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb dye, in the same way, as the Brahman Kūṭadanta was sitting in that very seat, the stainless, immaculate eye of Dhamma ( *dhammacakkhuṃ*) arose within him: "Whatever is subject to origination, all that is subject to cessation" (*yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammaṃ*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, having dispelled uncertainty, having attained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation, said this to the Blessed One: "May the Honorable Gotama accept a meal from me tomorrow, together with the Sangha of monks."

The Blessed One signified his acceptance with silence (*tuṇhībhāvena*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, knowing that the Blessed One had accepted, rose from his seat, respectfully bowed to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping his right side towards him, and departed.

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, as the night was ending, had prepared exquisite staple and non-staple food at his sacrificial ground, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready." The Discourse on the Virtues of Kūṭadanta

"Sir, do not visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

It is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

If you, sir, Kūṭadanta, visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him, your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama's reputation will increase.

Moreover, because your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama’s reputation will increase, for this reason it is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

The *samaṇa* Gotama, indeed, should visit you, Kūṭadanta, to see you.

"For you, Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent up to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable and without criticism regarding your birth.

If, Your Majesty, you were to levy taxes in such a thorny and afflicted realm, Your Majesty would be acting wrongly.
Perhaps Your Majesty may think: "I will completely eliminate this plague of robbers by execution, imprisonment, confiscation, threats or banishment," but this would not be the way to completely eliminate this plague of robbers.
Those who remain alive will later harm Your Majesty's realm.
However, by adopting this plan, this plague of robbers can be completely eliminated.
Therefore, Your Majesty should provide seeds and food to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising.
Your Majesty should provide goods to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in trade.
Your Majesty should fix proper wages and food for those in Your Majesty's realm who are in government service.
And those people, being devoted to their own occupations, will not harm Your Majesty's realm, and Your Majesty's revenue will be great.
The districts will be secure, free from thorns and oppression.
People, filled with joy and delight, will dance with their children in their arms, and I think they will live in open houses.’
'So be it, sir,' Brahman, King Mahāvijita, having promised the family priest, the Brahman, gave seeds and food to those in his kingdom who were engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising. Those in the king's countryside who engaged in trade, King Mahāvijita gave them gifts.

Those in the king's countryside who were royal officers, King Mahāvijita fixed their wages and salaries.

Those people, intent on their own occupations, did not harm the king's countryside, and the king's revenues were great.

The land was tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts played with their children and dwelt in open houses.

Then, King Mahāvijita sent for the chaplain and said: “I have gotten rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue has grown.”

The land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses.

Now I wish to make a great sacrifice.

Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.”

He is powerful, possessing a four-branched army that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy — a fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be heard, and he knows the meaning of each and every thing he has heard: ‘This is the meaning of this, this is the meaning of this.’ He is wise, accomplished, intelligent, and capable of reflecting on things past, future and present.

King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things.

These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice.

To the south of the sacrificial ground, the ministers and courtiers, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

To the west of the sacrificial ground, the wealthy *brāhmaṇa*s, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

To the north of the sacrificial ground, the wealthy householders, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

"In those sacrifices too, *brāhmaṇa*, neither cows were killed, nor goats or sheep were killed, nor chickens or pigs were killed, nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts (*yūpattha*), nor was *kuśa* grass cut for the sacrificial bedding (*barihisattha*).

And those who were their servants, whether slaves (*dāsa*), messengers (*pessa*), or workers (*kammakara*), did not perform their tasks for fear of punishment or threats, with tearful faces, weeping.

But those who wanted to do something, did it; those who did not want to do something, did not do it; they did what they wanted to do; and they did not do what they did not want to do.

And so those *yajñas* or sacrifices came to their completion with clarified butter, oil, fresh butter, curds, honey, and molasses.

"Thus, there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahāvijita was endowed with eight qualities, and the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa* was endowed with four qualities; this, *brāhmaṇa*, is called the threefold accomplishment of sacrifice, with its sixteen accessories."

Then those *brāhmaṇa*s said to the *brāhmaṇa* Kūṭadanta: "Why, friend Kūṭadanta, do you not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken?" "I do not, friends, approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.

The head of that person would fall off, who would not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.

Moreover, it seems to me, friends, that the *śramaṇa* Gotama does not say thus: 'Thus I have heard,' or 'Thus it should be,' but the *śramaṇa* Gotama speaks only thus: 'Thus it was then, in this way it was then.'

It seems to me, friends, that the *śramaṇa* Gotama must have been either King Mahāvijita at that time, the lord of the sacrifice (*yaññassāmi*), or the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa*, the performer of that sacrifice (*yaññassa yājetā*)."

Does the esteemed Gotama acknowledge that, having performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice (*yañña*), after the breaking up of the body, beyond death, one arises in a good destination, a heavenly world?" "I do acknowledge, *brāhmaṇa*, that, having performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice, after the breaking up of the body, beyond death, one arises in a good destination, a heavenly world; at that time, I was the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa*, the performer of that sacrifice."

Perpetual gift and appropriate sacrifice.

"It may well be so, Rosika, it may well be so."
Then the Blessed One went to the dwelling of Lohicca the Brahmin, and having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat.

And to those who ripen these divine seeds for rebirth in the world of the gods, he is a source of danger. Being a source of danger, he is uncompassionate. For the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view.

Of one with wrong view, Lohicca, I declare one of two destinies: hell or the animal realm. Three are worthy of blame.

                            "These three, Lohicca, are teachers who are worthy of blame in the world. And if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless.

Which three? Here, Lohicca, is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).

And without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma (dhamma), saying: "This is for your good, this is for your happiness."

His disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not arouse their minds to understand, and they err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

He should be blamed, saying: “Venerable one, you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but you have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha). You have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha), and yet you teach the Dhamma (dhamma) to your disciples, saying: ‘This is for your good, this is for your happiness.’

His disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not rouse their minds to understand, and they err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

It is just as if a man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him, and to embrace her though she turned away.” This I declare to be an evil doctrine based on attachment, for what can one man do for another?

This, Lohicca, is the first teacher who is worthy of blame in the world. And if anyone blames such a teacher, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless.

He should be blamed thus: "Venerable one, you went forth from the household life into homelessness for a certain purpose, and you have attained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).

                            "Again, Mahāli, a monk, facing south… west… north… upwards, downwards, or across, attains two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), and sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

By means of this two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, heavenly sights and sounds;
Why is that? It is because, Mahāli, in the two-sided developed *samādhi* of a monk, both upwards and downwards, heavenly sights are seen, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, and heavenly sounds are heard, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion.

That, Mahāli, is the cause, that is the reason why Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis, does not hear heavenly sounds though experiencing delightful sights connected with sensual pleasure and passion, but not sounds opposed to them.
“Surely, venerable sir, it is for the realisation of such *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?”
“No, Mahāli, it is not for the sake of realising these *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under me.
There are other states, Mahāli, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The four noble fruits.

“But what are those states, venerable sir, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?” “Here, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, becomes a *sotāpanna* (stream-enterer), no longer subject to falling into states of woe, assured, destined for enlightenment.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, becomes a *sakadāgāmī* (once-returner), who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, there to attain final *nirvāṇa*, never to return from that world.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the *āsavas* (influxes), in this very life, having realised it himself with *abhiññā* (direct knowledge), enters upon and abides in the taintless deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

These, Mahāli, are those states higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The Noble Eightfold Path
“But is there, venerable sir, a path, is there a method for the realisation of these states?” “There is a path, Mahāli, there is a method for the realisation of these states.”

“And what, venerable sir, is that path, what is that method for the realisation of these states?” “It is just this Noble Eightfold Path,
namely: right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*), right intention (*sammāsaṅkappo*), right speech (*sammāvācā*), right action (*sammākammanto*), right livelihood (*sammāājīvo*), right effort (*sammāvāyāmo*), right mindfulness (*sammāsati*), right *samādhi* (*sammāsamādhi*).
This, Mahāli, is the path, this is the method for the realisation of these states.
The incident of the two wanderers
“Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambi, in Ghosita Park.
Then two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and the wanderer Jāliya, a resident of the Dārupattika, approached me.
Having approached, they exchanged courteous greetings with me.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to me: ‘How is it, friend Gotama, is the *jīva* (life principle) the same as the body (*sarīra*), or is the *jīva* (life principle) one thing and the body another?’

“Then listen, friend, attend carefully, I will speak.”
‘Yes, friend,’ those two wanderers replied.
I said this: ‘Here, friend, the *tathāgata* (one who has thus come) arises in the world, an *arahaṃ* (worthy one), a *sammāsambuddho* (fully enlightened one)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be related in detail).
Thus, friend, a monk is accomplished in morality…pe…enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*.
Of that monk, friend, who knows thus, sees thus, is it fitting to say: ‘The *jīva* (life principle) is the same as the body’?”

Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him.

After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side.

Standing to one side, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard it said, friend Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapaṃ), and censures and blames all those ascetics (tapassiṃ) who lead a harsh (lūkhājīviṃ) life of self-mortification.’

Now, are those who say this telling the truth, and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies? Do they explain the truth about his *Dhamma* and what pertains to it, or does some fellow- teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this state­ment? For we do not wish to misrepresent the Lord Gotama."

A naked ascetic lives, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal.

He does not accept food out of a pot or a pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.

He is a one-house man or a one-morsel man, a two-house man or a two-morsel man… he is a seven-house man or a seven-morsel man; he maintains himself with even one gift, he maintains himself with even two gifts… he maintains himself with even seven gifts; he takes food once a day, he takes food once every two days… he takes food once every seven days.

Thus, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals, even up to once every fortnight.

                            “And how, Kassapa, is a *bhikkhu* perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*)? Here, Kassapa, a *bhikkhu*, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from taking life. He has laid aside the stick and the sword, he is scrupulous, kind, and dwells full of compassion for all living beings.

This also pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)… (as in sections 194 up to 210)

“Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, feeding on the food of the faithful, make their living by such base arts, such wrong means of livelihood

They make their living by: fortune-telling, interpreting omens… the prohibition of herbs and plants, and so on (as in section 211). He abstains from wrong livelihood, from such base arts.

This also pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*).

"And then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* who is thus perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*) sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality.

Just as, Kassapa, a Khattiya king who has been anointed on the head, having defeated his enemies, sees no danger from any side, namely, from the enemy.

Just so, Kassapa, the *bhikkhu* who is thus perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*) sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality.

Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*śīlakkhandha*), he experiences within himself a blameless happiness (*anavajjasukha*).

Thus, Kassapa, a *bhikkhu* is perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*).

That is the perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)… he enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*.

This also pertains to his perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*)… he enters upon and abides in the second *jhāna*… the third *jhāna*… the fourth *jhāna*.

This also pertains to his perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*).

That is the perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*).

“So when his mind is thus concentrated… he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)… he understands: ‘There is nothing further here’… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

That, Kassapa, is the perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

"And, Kassapa, there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*), of the heart (*cittasampadā*) and of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

                            At that time, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was sitting with a large assembly of wanderers, making a great noise and racket, engaged in many kinds of pointless conversation, such as:

Conversation about kings, robbers, ministers of state, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, street gossip, gossip by the well, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about the world and the sea, talk of being and non-being.

Here comes the *śramaṇa* (ascetic) Gotama.

That venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet.

Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.”

When this was said, the wanderers fell silent.

Then Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Come, venerable sir, Blessed One!

Welcome, venerable sir, to the Blessed One!

It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here.

Be seated, venerable sir, Blessed One; this seat is ready.”

The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready.

Poṭṭhapāda, too, taking a lower seat, sat down at one side.

As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer: "What was the topic of conversation for which you are gathered together here now? What was the discussion that was interrupted?"

Discussion about the cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodhakathā*).

                            When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Let that conversation be, venerable sir, the one we were sitting here discussing.

It won’t be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later.

Some days ago, venerable sir, some time ago, when various *tīrthika* (sectarians), ascetics, and *brāhmaṇas* were sitting together gathered in the assembly hall, a discussion arose about the cessation of perception: ‘How, indeed, venerable sirs, does the cessation of perception come about?’ Thereupon some said: ‘Sensations arise and cease in a person without cause or condition.

When they arise, one is percipient.

When they cease, one is not percipient.’

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.

"Then another said: ‘No, that’spī.

'No, sir, that is how it will be.'

Perception (*saññā*) is a person’s self (*attā*).

which comes and goes.

When it comes, one is percipient.

When it goes, one is not percipient.'

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodhaṃ).

"Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is, sir.

for there are contemplatives and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) of great power (mahiddhikā), great potency (mahānubhāvā).

They draw perception in and out of a person.

When they draw it in, one is percipient. “And, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, one’s abiding is stressful, you should not see it in that way.

“I also, Poṭṭhapāda, teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the mind-made appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms.
In the same way the Dhamma has been made clear by the Blessed One in many ways (*anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito*).
I go to the Blessed One for refuge (*bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi*), and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks (*bhikkhusaṅghañca*).
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life. At that time, it is.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception ( *abhisaññānirodha*).
“Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is.
for there are gods (*devatā*) of great power (*mahiddhikā*), great potency (*mahānubhāvā*).
They draw perception in and out of a person.
When they draw it in, one is percipient.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodha*).
“Then the memory of the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) arose within me: ‘Ah, the Blessed One (*bhagavā*)! Ah, the One Well-Gone (*sugato*)—who surely is well-skilled in these matters.’
The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodha*).
So what, lord (*bhante*), is the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodho*)?”

                            "And what is training (*sikkhā*)?" The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) said, "Here, Poṭṭhapāda, the *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one (*arahaṃ*), a fully enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).
“This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.… “Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
His earlier perception of sensuality (*kāmasaññā*) ceases.
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion.
And thus it is that with training one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.
This is training (*sikkhā*)" said the Blessed One (*bhagavā*). “And further, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of space (ākāsānañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite (anantaṃ viññāṇa).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.
And thus it is that with training one perception (saññā) arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.
“Again, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatana), thinking, ‘There is nothing (natthi kiñcī).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness.
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.

“Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception (saññaggaṃ).
As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ‘Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.’
If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?’
So he neither thinks nor wills.
So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear.
He touches cessation (nirodhaṃ phusati).
This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception (anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti).
“Now what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you ever before heard of such an alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception?” “No, venerable sir.”
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: ‘When the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ”Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.

“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” (evaṃ, poṭṭhapādā"ti)

“But, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.” (ekampi kho ahaṃ, poṭṭhapāda, saññaggaṃ paññapemi, puthūpi saññagge paññapemī"ti)

“But how, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, in whatever way one touches cessation, in that way I describe a peak of perception.

That’s how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.”

“Now, lord, does perception arise first, and knowledge after; or does knowledge arise first, and perception after; or do perception & knowledge arise simultaneously?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, perception arises first, and knowledge after. And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.

One discerns, ‘It’s in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen.’

Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first, and knowledge after, and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.”

The Discourse about Perception and Self

“Now, lord, is perception a person’s self, or is perception one thing and self another?”

“What sort of self do you posit, Poṭṭhapāda?”

“Lord, I posit a gross self, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be gross, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.

That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another:

even as there remains this gross self—possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, and feeding on food—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

even as there remains this mind-made self—complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a formless self made of perception.” (arūpiṃ kho ahaṃ, bhante, attānaṃ paccemi saññāmaya"nti.)

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be formless and made of perception. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

”even as there remains this formless self made of perception, one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Is it possible for me to know, lord, whether perception is a person’s self or if perception is one thing and self another?”
Poṭṭhapāda, since you have other views (aññadiṭṭhika), other practices (aññakhantika), other inclinations (aññarucikena), other aims (aññatrāyogena), and other teachers (aññatrācariyakena), it is difficult for you to know whether perception (saññā) is a person's self (attā), or whether perception is one thing and the self another.

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self (attā) would be formless (arūpī) and made of perception (saññāmayo). That being the case, then for you perception (saññā) would be one thing and self (attā) another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.

”even as there remains this formless self (attā) made of perception (saññāmayo), one perception (saññā) arises for that person as another perception (saññā) passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.”

                            Then, two or three days later, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One. Having arrived, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

But Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having exchanged courteous and agreeable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One, "Just now, *bhante*, those wanderers taunted me on all sides with words like stinging darts, saying, 'Indeed, whatever the venerable Poṭṭhapāda The contemplative Gotama speaks, and Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word: "So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-Gone."
But we don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or whether the cosmos is finite ( *antavā loko* ) or the cosmos is infinite ( *anantavā loko* ) or whether the soul and the body are the same ( *taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīraṃ*) or the soul is one thing and the body another ( *aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīraṃ*) or whether after death a Tathāgata exists ( *hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata does not exist ( *na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist ( *hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) or after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) .’

When this was said, I replied to the wanderers, ‘I, too, don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or… whether after death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist ( *neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ). But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma.

And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained, why shouldn’t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well-spokenness of the contemplative Gotama’s well-spoken words?”

Then they might say to him, ‘Good man, this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love: do you know her name or clan name? Whether she’s tall, short, or of medium height?

I approached them and asked: ‘Is it true that you, venerable sirs, hold such a view and doctrine: "The self after death is exclusively happy and free from disease"?’ If, when questioned thus, they acknowledge it as so,

I then say to them: ‘Do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Do you know that "This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Have you heard the voices of the gods who have been reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, "We are practicing well, dear ones; we are practicing uprightly, dear ones, for the realization of an exclusively happy world. It was through such practice that we were reborn in an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? In that case, doesn’t it follow that the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing?" "Indeed, lord, in that case, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing."

Three appropriations of self

"Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three appropriations of self (*attapaṭilābhā*): the gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), the mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), and the formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*).

And what, Poṭṭhapāda, is the gross appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), composed of the four great elements (*cātumahābhūtiko*), and feeds on solid food (*kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho*). This is the gross appropriation of a self.

And what is the mind-made appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), mind-made (*manomayo*), complete in all its parts (*sabbaṅgapaccaṅgī*), not deficient in its faculties (*ahīnindriyo*). This is the mind-made appropriation of a self.

And what is the formless appropriation of a self? It is formless (*arūpī*) and made of perception (*saññāmayo*). This is the formless appropriation of a self.

At Campā he stayed by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

At that time the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living at Campā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers, a gift according to Brahmanical rights ( *brahmadeyyaṃ*).

He declares this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses (*sassamaṇa*) and brahmins (*brāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and its people, which he has himself realised by direct knowledge (*abhiññā*).

He teaches the Dhamma that is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end, with the right meaning and expression, and reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure.

…Now it is good see such *arahants*.”

Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campā, leaving Campā in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

                            Just then, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest.

Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggara’s lotus-pond,

he asked his steward the reason. "Having departed from Campā, they are approaching the Gaggarā pond as an assembly, a crowd?" "Indeed, sir, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, a son of the Śākya clan, having gone forth from the Śākya family, wandering in the Aṅga country, has arrived at Campā together with a great community of *bhikkhus*, with approximately five hundred *bhikkhus*, and dwells in Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā pond.
And concerning that venerable Gotama such a fine reputation has arisen: 'Indeed, that Blessed One is an *arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'
They are approaching that venerable Gotama for a sight of him."
"Then, steward, go to the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka and say to them: 'The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: "Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him."'"
"Yes, sir," the steward replied to the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, and he approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, and having approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, he said this: "The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: 'Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.'"

The *brāhmaṇas* heard: "The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, it is said, will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him."
Then the *brāhmaṇas* approached the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, and having approached the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, they said this: "Is it true, sir, that the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him?"

"Sir, do not approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.
The *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is not worthy to approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.

And since the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa dwells in Campā, populous, with grass, timber, and water, with grain, a royal possession, given by King Bimbisāra, of Magadha, Seniya, a royal gift, a *brahmadeyya*,
by this reason the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is not worthy to approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him, but rather the *śramaṇa* Gotama is worthy to approach the *bhavantaṃ* Soṇadaṇḍa for a sight of him."

And since, sir, the *śramaṇa* Gotama is well-born on both sides, from mother and father, of pure descent as far back as the seventh generation of ancestors, unassailed, unimpeached in regard to birth, by this reason that *bhava* Gotama is not worthy to approach us for a sight of him.

Indeed, the Brahmin Pokkharasati has gone for refuge to the ascetic Gotama (Gotama), together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers.

The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests.
And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship guests.
Having come to Gaggara’s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such.
Therefore it is not proper that the revered Gotama should come to us to visit.
But rather we should go to the revered Gotama to visit.
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is insufficient, for the revered Gotama is beyond all praise.

                            Then Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin, straightening up, looking around the assembly, said to the Blessed One: “With five qualities, revered Gotama, Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood.

Which are the five? Here, revered Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both sides, from the mother's side and from the father's side, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth; he is a reciter, a holder of the *mantras* (mantradharo), one who has reached the further shore of the three *vedas* (vedānaṃ pāragū) with their vocabularies (*nighaṇḍu*) and supplementary texts (*keṭubha*), skilled in phonology (*sākkharappabheda*), and the lore of legends as a fifth, versed in the etymology (*padako*) and grammar (*veyyākaraṇo*), and experienced in the *lokāyata* (lokāyata) and the characteristics of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇa*); he is handsome, pleasant to look at, inspiring confidence, possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion, with a brahmin-like appearance and a brahmin-like glow, not dwarfish, and delightful to behold; he is virtuous, with developed virtue, possessed of developed virtue; and he is learned and wise, whether he be the first or the second to accept the sacrificial ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these five qualities, revered Gotama, that Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood.”

“But, Brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five qualities, so that with four qualities, Brahmins might designate a Brahmin, and that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?” ‘It is possible, Gotama.’
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out appearance of these five qualities.
What can appearance do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unimpeached, irreproachable in matters of caste; he is a reciter and upholder of the mantras, one who has gone to the further shore of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, etymologies and phonology, and with the lore of legends as a fifth, skilled in word and sentence, and a master of Lokāyata and the characteristics of a great man; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
If a Brahmin is endowed with these four qualities, Brahmins recognize him as a Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood.’

                            Now at that time, Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin's* nephew, a young man named Aṅgaka, was sitting in that assembly.

Then Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin* said to those *brāhmins*: “Do you see this young man Aṅgaka, my nephew?” “Yes, sir.”

“Aṅgaka, is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, endowed with the highest beauty, with the hue of Brahmā, the splendor of Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama.

Aṅgaka, is a student, a *mantra*-reciter, a master of the three *vedas*, along with their vocabularies (nighaṇḍu), etymology (keṭubha), phonology (sākkharappabheda), and histories as the fifth (itihāsapañcama); he is skilled in philology (padaka) and grammar (veyyākaraṇa), and is fully versed in natural philosophy (lokāyata) and the marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisalakkhaṇa).

I am his teacher of *mantras*.

Aṅgaka, is well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent for seven generations, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to his birth.

I know his parents.

Aṅgaka, could even kill a living being, take what is not given, go to another’s wife, speak falsely, and drink intoxicants. What good then, sir, would appearance do, what good would *mantras* do, what good would birth do? But when, sir, a *brāhmin* is virtuous, of advanced virtue, endowed with advanced virtue, and wise, intelligent, whether he is first or second in seizing the ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these two qualities that *brāhmins* recognize a *brāhmin*, and one who declares, ‘I am a *brāhmin*’ would speak truthfully, and would not incur falsehood.”

It would be well if the venerable Gotama himself would clarify the meaning of this statement."
“Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa to the Blessed One.

                            When this was said, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable Gotama, excellent, venerable Gotama.
Just as, venerable Gotama, one might set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see forms, in the same way the Dharma has been made clear in many ways by venerable Gotama.
I go to the venerable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dharma, and to the *Bhikkhu-saṃgha*.
May the esteemed Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forth, as long as life shall last. Morality is [now] covered.
And may the Reverend Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Community of monks.
The Lord signified his acceptance by silence.
Then Sonadanda, the Brahmin, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Lord, and circumambulating him, departed.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, as the night was ending, had exquisite staple and non-staple food prepared in his own home, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It’s time, good Gotama. The meal is ready.”
Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the early morning and taking his bowl and robes, went with the Community of *bhikkhus* to Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*'s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* personally served the Community of *bhikkhus*, with the Buddha at their head, with choice staple and non-staple food until they were satisfied.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.
Sitting to one side, Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* said this to the Blessed One: "If, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to rise from my seat and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer.
And if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to raise my joined palms [in greeting], may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to take off my turban, may the Reverend Gotama take it as a bow of my head.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to alight from the carriage and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer, and if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to raise my goad, may the Reverend Gotama consider that as my alighting from the carriage.”

The Blessed One praised these three aggregates, Subha, and in these he encouraged, trained, and established this populace." Just as if, young man, a person were to draw out a reed from its sheath.
He would think: ‘This is the reed, this is the sheath; the reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’
Or as if, young man, a person were to draw a sword from its scabbard.
He would think: ‘This is the sword; this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’
Or as if, young man, a person were to pull a snake out from its slough.
He would think: ‘This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake is one, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has been pulled out.’
In the same way, young man, a *bhikkhu* … and also, young man, when a *bhikkhu*’s mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilements, softened, workable, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the creation of a mind-made body (*manomayaṃ kāyaṃ* )…
This comes to him through wisdom (*paññāya*).

He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth (*jāti*), the spiritual life (*brahmacariya*) has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’

"Just as if, Māṇava, there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and undisturbed.

There are these shells, this gravel, and these shoals of fish, both moving and still.’

In the same way, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu*… and also, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu* with mind concentrated directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions.

                            "Well, Reverend Ānanda, what is the noble virtue category ( *ariya sīlakkhandho* ) which the Reverend Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, established, and grounded this populace?"
"Here, young sir ( *māṇava* ), a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arahaṃ*, a fully enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugato*, knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), the Awakened One ( *buddho* ), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*).
He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and people (*pajaṃ*), with its gods and humans (*sadevamanussaṃ*).
He teaches the *Dhamma* that is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with its meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with its wording (*sabyañjanaṃ*), perfectly complete (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*), thoroughly pure (*parisuddhaṃ*), he reveals the holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).
A householder (*gahapati*) or a householder’s son (*gahapatiputto*) or one born in some other clan hears that *Dhamma*.
Having heard this *Dhamma*, he gains faith (*saddhaṃ*) in the *Tathāgata*.
He, endowed with that gaining of faith (*saddhāpaṭilābhena samannāgato*), reflects thus: ‘The household life is crowded, a dusty path; the ascetic life is open. It is not easy, while living in a house, to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ*) like a polished shell.’
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya’nti*)?’
Then, at a later time, having abandoned a small or a large fortune ( *bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya*), having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives (*ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya*), he shaves off his hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and goes forth from the home life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati*).
Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the *Pātimokkha-saṃvara*, possessed of proper behavior and resort (*ācāragocarasampanno*), seeing danger in the slightest faults (*anumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī*), undertaking the training (*sikkhā*) in the rules of training (*sikkhāpadesu*), endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action (*kāyakammavacīkammena samannāgato kusalena*), his livelihood is purified (*parisuddhājīvo*), he is possessed of moral discipline (*sīlasampanno*), with the sense-doors guarded (*indriyesu guttadvāro*), endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena samannāgato*), and is content (*santuṭṭho*).

(This should be elaborated as in sections 194 to 210).

"Or he might say: ‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings, practicing demonology, working spells to cause abundance, inducing virility, inducing impotence, preparing and consecrating sites for houses, performing ceremonial mouthwashes, performing ceremonial bathing, offering sacrificial fires, administering emetics, administering purgatives, administering expectorants, administering downward-acting purgatives, administering head-cleansing remedies, administering ear-oil, administering eye-salves, performing nasal treatments, applying medicinal ointments, applying counter-ointments, practicing eye-surgery, practicing surgery, practicing children's medicine, dispensing root medicines, and dispensing herbal medicines.’ Thus he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

Even so, Māṇava, a monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood whereby some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living, such as performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings…pe…dispensing herbal medicines.

Then King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, on that *uposatha* day, uttered this solemn utterance: ‘Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Lovely is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night!’
“Which ascetic or Brahmin should we visit tonight, that our mind might find peace in his presence?”

Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me evasively.
And I thought: “Of all these ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas*, Sañjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused.
How should one, when asked about the visible fruit of recluseship, answer evasively?”
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or *Brahmin* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Sañjaya Belatthaputta nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

The thought might occur to him: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvelous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds! This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is a human being, and I too am a human being. This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is endowed and furnished with the five strands of sensual pleasure, he enjoys himself, I think, like a god. But I am his slave, his worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to his wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please him. I ought to do something meritorious!

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

After some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having gone forth in this way, he lives restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the bare necessities of food and clothing, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: ‘Your Majesty should know, that man, your slave, your worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to your wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please you—that man, Your Majesty, has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness.’" Having gone forth, he dwells restrained in body ( *kāyena saṃvuto viharati*), speech (*vācāya saṃvuto viharati*), and mind (*manasā saṃvuto viharati*), content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.
Would you say: ‘Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become my slave, my workman, rising before me, retiring after me, doing whatever I want, acting always for my pleasure, speaking politely to me, ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied.’?”

Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.
Answer as you see fit.
What do you think, great king? Suppose there is a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
He might think: “It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds (*puññānaṃ gati, puññānaṃ vipāko*)!
For this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*), is a human being (*manusso*), and I too am a human being (*manusso*).
Yet this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*) enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure (*pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappito samaṅgībhūto paricāreti*) as if he were a god, I think.
Whereas I am a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
I ought to do something meritorious (*puññāni kareyyaṃ*).
What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’
"After some time, he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small, abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and He would go forth from home into homelessness.

And he, having thus gone forth, might dwell restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: “Sire, you remember that man. .. who was a farmer, a householder, who paid taxes to maintain the royal revenue; that man, O king, has shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, and has gone forth from his home into the homeless life.”

And he, having thus gone forth, lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.”

Would you then say: “That man must come back and be a steward as before”?

Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind (**_manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ_**), evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, said this to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “But why are you silent, friend Jīvaka?”

“This Blessed One, worthy and perfectly enlightened, is staying in our mango grove with a large Saṃgha of monks, with thirteen hundred monks.

This good report about that Blessed One [Blessed One Gotama] has spread thus: ‘Indeed, that Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of the world, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’

May Your Majesty visit that Blessed One.

Perhaps if you visit the Blessed One, it might bring peace to your mind."

Then, when King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, was not far from the mango grove, fear arose in him, trepidation arose, and terror arose.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, frightened and agitated, with his hair standing on end, said this to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Are you not deceiving me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not tricking me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not handing me over to my enemies, friend Jīvaka? Why would there be no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no noise, in such a large Saṃgha of monks, of thirteen hundred monks?"

“Do not fear, Great King, do not fear, Great King.

I am not deceiving you, Your Majesty; I am not tricking you, Your Majesty; I am not handing you over to your enemies, Your Majesty.

Go forward, Great King, go forward, Great King. There are lights burning in the round pavilion.”

                            "Great king, suppose a man were to go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village.

Then he might return from that village to his own village.

He might think to himself: 'I went from my own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to still another village. There too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I returned to my own village.'

In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, without blemish, rid of defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the *bhikkhu* directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇa*).

He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction (*saṃvaṭṭakappa*), many aeons of world-expansion (*vivaṭṭakappa*), many aeons of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappa*): ‘There I was so named (*evaṃnāmo*), of such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), with such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*), such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my life-term (*evamāyupariyanto*). Passing away from there, I arose in that place. There, too, I was so named, of such a clan, of such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away from there, he was reborn here.'

Thus, he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*) more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. Knowledge of the divine eye.

and he might think: ‘These people are entering a house, these are leaving, these are walking along the street, these are sitting in the middle of the square.’

Just so, great king, when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.

But these worthy beings were endowed with good conduct in body (kāyasucarita), speech (vacīsucarita), and mind (manosucarita), who did not revile the Noble Ones (ariyānaṃ anupavādakā), who held right view (sammādiṭṭhikā) and undertook actions under the influence of right view (sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā).

At the breaking up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), after death (paraṃ maraṇā), they have been reborn in a happy destination (sugatiṃ), in the world of Heaven (saggaṃ lokaṃ upapannā’ti).

Thus, with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā), purified (visuddhena) and surpassing that of humans (atikkantamānusakena), he sees beings (satte) passing away (cavamāne) and re-arising (upapajjamāne), inferior (hīne) and superior (paṇīte), beautiful (suvaṇṇe) and ugly (dubbaṇṇe), fortunate (sugate) and unfortunate (duggate), and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions (yathākammūpage satte pajānāti).

Having concluded the courteous and amiable talk, I sat down to one side.

And he knows as it really is: “These are the corruptions (*āsavā*)”, “This is the origin of the corruptions (*āsavasamudayo*)”, “This is the cessation of the corruptions (*āsavanirodho*)”, “This is the path leading to the cessation of the corruptions (*āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*)".

And through his knowing and seeing thus, his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense-desire (*kāmāsava*), from the corruption of becoming (*bhavāsava*), from the corruption of ignorance (*avijjāsava*), and the knowledge arises in him: “This is deliverance!”, and he knows: “Birth (*jāti*) is finished, the holy life (*brahmacariya*) has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here."

This, great king (*mahārāja*), is a visible fruit (*sāmaññaphala*) of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

And, great king (*mahārāja*), there is no other fruit of recluseship (*sāmaññaphala*) higher or more sublime than this one."

                            “When this was said, venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa said this to me: ‘Great king, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief or causes to grieve, by one who causes weariness or causes to be wearied, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies—no evil (pāpaṃ) is done.

If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass of flesh (maṃsakhalaṃ), one single heap of flesh (maṃsapuñjaṃ), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing (hananto), slaying (ghātento), cutting (chindanto) or causing to be cut (chedāpento), burning (pacanto) or causing to be burnt (pācāpento), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving (dadanto) and causing to be given (dāpento), sacrificing (yajanto) and causing to be sacrificed (yajāpento), there would be no merit (puññaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo).

In giving (dānena), self-control (damena), restraint (saṃyamena) and truthful speech (saccavajjena) there is no merit (puññaṃ), and no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo)’.

Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

“Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango (ambaṃ) would speak about a breadfruit (labujaṃ), or as if one asked about a breadfruit (labujaṃ) would speak about a mango (ambaṃ), in the same way when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse (samaṇaṃ) or Brahmin (brāhmaṇaṃ) living in his realm (vijite vasantaṃ)’.

So I, venerable sir, neither rejoiced in the statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa (pūraṇassa kassapassa bhāsitaṃ) nor did I reject it (neva abhinandiṃ nappaṭikkosiṃ).

Without having rejoiced Without rejecting it, feeling displeased, not uttering a word of dissatisfaction, but accepting his doctrine without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

There is no cause, no condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without a cause or condition.

There is no self-determination, no determination by others, no human determination. There is no strength, no energy, no human power, no human might.

All beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are without power, without strength, without energy; subject to the changes of destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.

There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin and sixty and six hundred more. There are five hundred kinds of action, five kinds of action, three kinds of action, full action and half-action; sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate aeons, six classes, eight stages of human progress, forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood, forty-nine hundred kinds of wanderers, forty-nine hundred abodes of *nāgas*, two thousand faculties, thirty hundred hells, thirty-six realms of elements, seven conscious embryos, seven unconscious embryos, seven *nigaṇṭha* embryos, seven gods, seven humans, seven *piśācas*, seven lakes, seven whirlpools, seven hundred whirlpools, seven precipices, seven hundred precipices, seven dreams, seven hundred dreams, eighty-four great *kappas*, hundreds of thousands, which both fools and wise, wandering through transmigration, will make an end to suffering.

There. There is no such thing as: "Through this virtuous conduct ( *śīla*), or observance ( *vata*), or austerity ( *tapas*), or holy life ( *brahmacarya*), I will ripen action ( *karma*) that is not yet ripe, or I will gradually eliminate action (*karma*) that is already ripe."
Pleasure and pain are meted out in this round of rebirths ( *saṃsāra*) which has fixed limits; there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it.
Just as a ball of string, when thrown, unrolls until it comes to its end, so too, by running and wandering through the round of rebirths (*saṃsāra*), both fools and the wise will make an end to suffering (*duḥkhassāntaṃ*).

Four men carry the corpse along on a bier.
their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground.
There the bones whiten, the sacrifice ends in ashes.

They do not shake, they do not change, they do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain.

Herein, there is no killer, no slayer, no hearer, no proclaimer, neither knower nor causer of knowing.

Even he who cuts off a head with a sharp sword, he does not deprive anyone of life; the sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies.

There, the Blessed One stayed in Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove (*ambavana*) on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

Now a good reputation has spread concerning the esteemed Gotama: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arahant*, a perfectly enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*), perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugata*, a knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed, a trainer of those who can be trained (*purisadammasārathi*), a teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed One (*bhagavā*).'

Come, Bhāradvāja, let us go to the ascetic Gotama. Having gone to him, let us ask the ascetic Gotama about this matter.

As the ascetic Gotama explains to us, so we will remember it."

"So be it, sir," the youth Bhāradvāja replied to the youth Vāseṭṭha.
