                    <div class="translation">Having taken various sorts of *khāri* [or, taking a *khāri* of various sorts], he enters the forest dwelling, thinking, ‘I will live on windfalls.’ In this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This, Ambaṭṭha, is the first path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

“Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket and enters the forest, thinking, ‘I will live on tubers, roots, and fruits.’ In this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This, Ambaṭṭha, is the second path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

“Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on windfalls or on tubers, roots, and fruits, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame. In this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This, Ambaṭṭha, is the third path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

“Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on windfalls or on tubers, roots, and fruits, or to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: ‘Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.’ In this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This, Ambaṭṭha, is the fourth path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

These, Ambaṭṭha, are the four paths of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?” “No, Gotama.”

‘Where was I...? “Good Gotama, with your teacher, what is the unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct? I am far, good Gotama, from the unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct, with my teacher.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls, being unable to gain that, take your digging stick and basket and go into the depths of the forest, intending to live on tubers, roots, and fruits?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls, being unable to gain that, live on tubers, roots, and fruits, being unable to gain that, make a fire hut near a village or town, attending to the fire?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls, being unable to gain that, live on tubers, roots, and fruits, being unable to gain that, attend to the fire, being unable to gain that, build a four-doored guest house at the crossroads, thinking, ‘Whatever ascetic or Brahmin comes from these four directions, we will treat them according to our ability and power’?” “No, Gotama.”

282. “And so, Ambaṭṭha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unsurpassed perfection of knowledge and conduct,

but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.

And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.

See how your teacher has let you down!

The pursuit of the state of the ancient seers.

283. “Ambaṭṭha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.

When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.

Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bes­towed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

See how your teacher has let you down!

284. “What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.

And suppose he were to step aside

and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Passenadi of Kosala says!”

Would he be speaking the King’s words, or speaking the King’s counsel? Would he thereby be a king or a minister?” “No, Gotama.”

285. “Well then, Ambaṭṭha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today — Aṣṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamātaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu — whose *mantras* are said to be passed on to you and your teacher: yet you do not thereby become a *ṛṣi* or one practised in the way of a *ṛṣi* — such a thing is not possible.

286. “What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first sages… Those brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken and reciting what was recited, whose ancient hymn verses that were formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled- that is, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. Did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, well-anointed, with trimmed hair and beards, adorned with jeweled earrings and ornaments [wearing garlands of ornaments (sī.
syā.
pī.)], dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five sense objects and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Venerable Gotama, not that."
"...pe...did they eat special fine rice with various soups and curries, seasoned with choice black spices, as you and your teacher do now?" "No, Venerable Gotama, not that."
"...pe...did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?" "No, Venerable Gotama, not that."
"...pe...did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on by long goad-sticks, as you and your teacher do now?" "No, Venerable Gotama, not that."
"...pe...did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with moats and palisades, by men with long swords [long swords and armour (syā.
pī.)], as you and your teacher do now?" "No, Venerable Gotama, not that."
"So, Ambaṭṭha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage nor trained in the way of a sage.
And now, Ambaṭṭha, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, I will clarify these by your asking me questions, and by my answering them."
Display of the two characteristics.

287.
Then the Blessed One, leaving his dwelling, started to walk up and down.
Ambaṭṭha the youth also, leaving his dwelling, started to walk up and down.
Then Ambaṭṭha the youth, walking behind the Blessed One as he walked up and down, examined the thirty-two marks of a great man on the body of the Blessed One.
Ambaṭṭha the youth saw the thirty-two marks of a great man on the body of the Blessed One, for the most part, except for two.
He was doubtful and uncertain about two of these marks: he could not decide and make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.

288.
Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “This Ambaṭṭha the youth sees the thirty-two marks of a great man on me, except for two.
He is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.”
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that Ambaṭṭha the youth saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was enclosed in a sheath.
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue.
Then the following thought occurred to Ambaṭṭha the youth: "The ascetic Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man; they are complete, not incomplete."
He said to the Blessed One: “And now, Venerable Gotama, may I depart? I am busy and have much to do.”
“Now is the time, Ambaṭṭha, to do as you think fit.”
Then Ambaṭṭha the youth, mounting his chariot drawn by mares, departed.

289.
Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had gone outside to Ukkaṭṭha and was sitting in his own park with a large crowd of brahmins, expecting Ambaṭṭha the youth.
Then Ambaṭṭha the youth proceeded to his own park.
As far as the ground was suitable for carriages, he went by carriage; then, dismounting from the carriage, he went on foot to the place where the brahmin Pokkharasāti was; having approached, he greeted the brahmin Pokkharasāti respectfully, and sat down to one side.

290.
When Ambaṭṭha the youth was seated to one side, the brahmin Pokkharasāti said to him: “Did you see the Venerable Gotama, my dear Ambaṭṭha?” “I did see the Venerable Gotama, sir.”
“And is the Venerable Gotama such as the report of him that has spread abroad really is, and not otherwise? And is that Venerable Gotama of such a kind, and not ‘And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?’” “Yes, sir, the report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true, and not otherwise; he is of such nature, and not otherwise.

He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing.’

‘But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?” “There was, sir.”

‘And what was this conversation about?” Then Ambattha told the Brahmin Pokkharasāti all that had passed between the Lord and himself.

291.

At this Pokkharasāti exclaimed: ‘Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell!

You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!

You’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell!” He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over.

and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord.

Pokkharasāti's visit to the Buddha.

292.

But the Brahmins said: ‘It is far too late, sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today.

The Reverend Pokkharasāti should go to see him tomorrow.’

Then the brahmin Pokkharasāti had good food of various kinds prepared in his residence, had it loaded on a carriage, and He set out for Ukkaṭṭha while being carried, and he travelled to the forest grove of Icchānaṅgala.

Going by vehicle as far as the ground allowed for a vehicle, he dismounted and approached the Blessed One on foot.

Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging friendly and polite conversation, he sat down to one side.

293.

Seated to one side, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti said this to the Blessed One: “Venerable Gotama, did our pupil, the young man Ambaṭṭha, come here?”

“He did come, Brahmin, your pupil, the young man Ambaṭṭha.”

“Did you have any conversation with Ambaṭṭha, Venerable Gotama?” “I did, Brahmin, I had some conversation with Ambaṭṭha.”

“What was the conversation that you had with Ambaṭṭha, Venerable Gotama?” Then the Blessed One told the Brahmin Pokkharasāti all the conversation he had had with the young man Ambaṭṭha.

When this was said, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti said this to the Blessed One: “Ambaṭṭha is a young fool, Reverend Gotama, may the Reverend Gotama forgive Ambaṭṭha.”

“May the young man Ambaṭṭha be happy, Brahmin.”

294.

Then the Brahmin Pokkharasāti examined the thirty-two marks of a great man on the body of the Blessed One.

The Brahmin Pokkharasāti saw on the body of the Blessed One most of the thirty-two marks of a great man, except for two.

He doubted and was uncertain about two of the marks of a great man: the concealing of the male organ in a sheath (kosohite vatthaguyhe), and the possession of a large tongue (pahūtajivhatāya).

295.

Then it occurred to the Blessed One: "This Brahmin Pokkharasāti sees in my body most of the thirty-two marks of a great man, except for two.

He doubts and is uncertain about two of the marks of a great man: the concealing of the male organ in a sheath (kosohite ca vatthaguyhe), and the possession of a large tongue (pahūtajivhatāya ca)."

Then the Blessed One brought about such a feat of psychic power that the Brahmin Pokkharasāti saw the Blessed One's male organ concealed in a sheath (kosohitaṃ vatthaguyhaṃ).

Then Then, indeed, the Blessed One, having extended his tongue, stroked and touched both ear-holes, stroked and touched both nostrils, and even covered the entire circle of his forehead with his tongue.

296. Then, the Brahman Pokkharasāti considered: “Indeed, the renunciate Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man ( *dvattiṃsamahāpurisalakkhaṇa*), complete and not incomplete."

He said this to the Blessed One: "May the esteemed Gotama accept a meal from me today, together with the community of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅgha* )!"

The Blessed One consented in silence.

297. Then the Brahman Pokkharasāti, knowing that the Blessed One had accepted, announced the time to the Blessed One, saying: "It is time, venerable Gotama, the meal is ready."

Then, the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went to the residence of the Brahman Pokkharasāti together with the community of monks, and having arrived, sat down on the prepared seat.

Then the Brahman Pokkharasāti personally served the Blessed One with excellent hard and soft food, satisfying him, and the young men ( *māṇavaka* ) served the community of monks.

Then the Brahman Pokkharasāti, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.

298. As the Brahman Pokkharasāti was sitting to one side, the Blessed One gave a progressive discourse ( *anupubbikatha* ), that is to say, a talk on giving ( *dānakatha*), a talk on morality ( *sīlakatha*), a talk on heaven ( *saggakatha*), the danger, worthlessness and defilement of sensual pleasures ( *kāma*), and he revealed the benefit of renunciation (*nekkhamma*).

When the Blessed One knew that the Brahman Pokkharasāti had a pliable mind, a gentle mind, a mind free from hindrances, an uplifted mind, and a clear mind, then he revealed the teaching special to the Buddhas, the discourse on the Dharma ( *dhamma* ) which is the suffering ( *dukkha* ), its origin ( *samudaya* ), its cessation ( *nirodha* ), and the path ( *magga* ).

Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly absorb dye, in the same way, as the Brahman Pokkharasāti was sitting there, the stainless, immaculate eye of the Dhamma ( *dhamma-cakkhu* ) arose in him: "Whatever is subject to origination, all that is subject to cessation ( *yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamma* )."

Pokkharasāti's declaration of being a lay follower ( *upāsaka*).

299. Then, the Brahman Pokkharasāti, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, having eliminated perplexity, In the context of speaking: "You know the Dhamma that I know, and I know the Dhamma that you know."

257. Then the Brahmin Pokkharasāti addressed the young man Ambaṭṭha, "Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyas, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala with a large community of monks, with about five hundred monks, has arrived at Icchānaṅgala, and is staying in the grove of Icchānaṅgala.

And concerning that Blessed Gotama, such a good reputation has been spread about: ‘Indeed, that Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the Worlds, unsurpassed Trainer of those who can be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed One.’

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its gods (devas), Māras, and Brahmās, its ascetics (śramaṇa) and Brahmins, its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge.

He teaches the Dhamma, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the spirit and the letter; He reveals the spiritual life (brahmacariya) that is utterly perfect and pure.

It is good to see such arahants."

"Come now, Ambaṭṭha, go to where the ascetic Gotama is, and having gone, find out about the ascetic Gotama: whether the report about the esteemed Gotama is actually true, or not.

Whether the esteemed Gotama is such a person or not; in that way we shall know the esteemed Gotama."

258. "But how shall I know, sir, the esteemed Gotama—whether the report about the esteemed Gotama is actually true, or not?

Whether the esteemed Gotama is such a person or not?"

"Come now, dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man (mahāpurisalakkhaṇa) have been handed down in our mantras, and the great man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other.

If he lives the household life, he will become a king, a wheel-turning monarch (cakkavattī), a righteous king (dhammarājā) who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters, all-victorious, who has stabilized his country and possesses the seven treasures (sattaratana).

He has these seven treasures.

Namely: the wheel-treasure (cakkaratana), the elephant-treasure (hatthiratana), the horse-treasure (assaratana), the jewel-treasure (maṇiratana), the woman-treasure (itthiratana), the steward-treasure (gahapatiratana), and the counselor-treasure (pariṇāyakaratana) as the seventh.

He has more than a thousand sons They are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army.
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the Dhamma.
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an *arhat*, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.
And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the *mantras*, and you are the receiver.’
259.
‘Very good, sir’, said Ambattha at Pokkharasati’s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men, headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala.
He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot to the *ārāma*.
At that time a number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air.
Then Ambattha approached those monks and said: ‘Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? For we have come here to see the Reverend Gotama.’
260.
Then those monks thought: ‘This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati.
The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man.’
They said to Ambattha: "That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door to you".
261.
Then Ambattha approached the dwelling, which had its door shut, quietly and without haste, entered the porch, coughed, and knocked on the bolt.
The Blessed One opened the door.
Ambattha entered.
The young men also entered and exchanged greetings with the Blessed One. After courteous and agreeable talk, they sat down to one side.
But Ambattha, while walking back and forth, exchanged some words of civility with the Blessed One who was seated; even while standing, he exchanged some words of civility with the Blessed One who was seated.
262.
Then the Blessed One said to Ambattha: ‘Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?”
First quarrel about (low) birth.
263.
“No indeed, Reverend Gotama!
A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down.
But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahma’s foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama”.
‘But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should pay close attention to hear about it.
Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience.”
264.
But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking: ‘The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will’, he said: ‘Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins.
*kaṃ*.
*pī*.
)], not They do not honor the Brahmins, they do not respect the Brahmins, they do not venerate the Brahmins.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The second accusation of meniality.

“But what offense have these Śākyas committed against you, Ambaṭṭha?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, my Brahmin teacher.

I went to the Śākyas’ meeting hall.

And at that time, many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in their assembly hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, seemingly just mocking me; no one even invited me to a seat.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials.

The third accusation of meniality.

‘But Ambaṭṭha, even a quail, that little bird, can chirp as she likes in her own nest.

Kapilavatthu is the Śākyas’ own, Ambaṭṭha; the esteemed Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.’

“Venerable Gotama, there are these four social classes (*varṇa*): nobles (*kṣatriya*), Brahmins, merchants (*vaiśya*), and laborers (*śūdra*).

And of these four social classes, venerable Gotama, the three social classes—nobles, merchants, and laborers—are, in fact, merely attendants of the Brahmins.

With regard to this, venerable Gotama, it is improper, it is unseemly that these Śākyas, being menials, considering themselves menials, do not pay homage to the Brahmins, do not respect the Brahmins, do not esteem the Brahmins, do not venerate the Brahmins, and do not defer to the Brahmins.’

This was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student accused the Śākyas of being menials. Insulting with the term "born of a slave girl."

267. Then the Lord thought: ‘This young man Ambaṭṭha goes too far in abusing the Sakyans with haughty talk. Suppose I were to ask after his clan name?"

So he said to Ambaṭṭha: ‘Ambaṭṭha, what is your clan?" "I am a Kaṇhāyana, venerable Gotama."

‘Ambaṭṭha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans.’

For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor.

At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika and Sinisūra.

And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.

And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters.

"Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and courtiers, saying: ‘Where are the princes now gathering together?’ ‘Sire, there is on the flank of the Himalayas a great teak grove beside a lotus-pond, and there the princes are gathering together. And for fear of contaminating the stock, they are cohabiting with their own sisters.’

At this King Okkāka exclaimed: “They are strong as teak, these princes, they are real Sakyans!”

From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Sakyans have been known as such, and he was their first ancestor.

‘Now King Okkaka had a slave-girl called Disā,

who gave birth to a black child (kaṇhaṃ).

The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bathe me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!”

Because, Ambaṭṭha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black.

And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kaṇha, a hobgoblin!”

From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Kaṇhāyanas have been known as such, and he was the first ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas. "Because when you, Ambaṭṭha, recall the ancient lineage through mother and father, the noble-born are the Sakyans, and you are the son of a slave girl of the Sakyans."

268.
When this was said, the young men said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Gotama, do not humiliate Ambaṭṭha too much with talk of descent from a slave girl.
Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is well-born, Reverend Gotama, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is from a good family, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is very learned, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, has a good delivery, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is wise, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is capable of holding his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama."

269.
Then the Blessed One said to the young men: "If you think that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is ill-born, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is not from a good family, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is unlearned, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, has a poor delivery, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is unwise, and that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is not capable of holding his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambaṭṭha, the youth, be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me.
But if you think that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is well-born, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is from a good family, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is very learned, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, has a good delivery, that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is wise, and that Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is capable of holding his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then you be silent, and let Ambaṭṭha, the youth, discuss with me."
"Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is well-born, Reverend Gotama, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is from a good family, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is very learned, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, has a good delivery, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is wise, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, is capable of holding his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama, we will be silent, let Ambaṭṭha, the youth, discuss with the Reverend Gotama."

270.
Then the Blessed One said to Ambaṭṭha, the youth: "Ambaṭṭha, a fundamental question comes to you, which you will not like to answer.
If you don’t answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent,
or go away, your head will split into seven pieces.
What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable *brāhmaṇas*, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?"
When this was said, Ambaṭṭha, the youth, remained silent.
The Lord asked Ambaṭṭha, the youth, a second time: "What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable *brāhmaṇas*, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?" Ambaṭṭha, the youth, remained silent a second time.
Then the Blessed One said to Ambaṭṭha, the youth: "Answer now, Ambaṭṭha, this is not a time for silence.
Whoever, Ambaṭṭha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a *Tathāgata* by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces."

271.
At that moment, Vajirapāṇi the *yakṣa*, holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, was standing in the sky just above Ambaṭṭha, the youth, thinking: "If this young man Ambaṭṭha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!"
The Lord saw Vajirapāṇi, the *yakṣa*, and so did Ambaṭṭha, the youth.

272.
Then Ambaṭṭha, the youth, terrified and unnerved, his hairs standing on end, sought protection, shelter, and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said: "What did the Reverend Gotama say? Let the Reverend Gotama say it again."
"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable *brāhmaṇas*, teachers of teachers, where the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?" "Yes, Reverend Gotama, I have heard it as the Reverend Gotama said.
The Kanhayans came from there, and he was their ancestor." Ambaṭṭha Lineage Story
273.
When this was said, those youths, making a loud noise and clamor, exclaimed: “Indeed, Ambaṭṭha the young man is ill-born, not of a good family! Indeed, Ambaṭṭha the young man is the son of a slave girl! Indeed, Ambaṭṭha the young man belongs to the Śākyas!"
Indeed, the Śākyas are the masters of Ambaṭṭha!
Indeed, we thought the ascetic Gotama was not worth disparaging, because he speaks the truth!"
274.
Then the Lord thought: "These youths are humiliating Ambaṭṭha too much by calling him the son of a slave-girl. I should get him out of this."
Then the Lord said this to the youths: "Do not disparage Ambaṭṭha too much for being the son of a slave-girl!
That Kanhha was a mighty *ṛṣi* (sage).
He went to the southern region, learned the *brahmamantras* (Brahmin mantras), approached king Okkāka, and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī in marriage.
Then King Okkāka, furiously angry, exclaimed: “So this fellow, the son of a slave-girl, wants my daughter!”, and put an arrow to his bow.
But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it.
"Then, youths, the ministers and counselors came to the *ṛṣi* (sage) Kanhha and said: “May there be safety, reverend sir, may there be safety for the king!”
‘There will be safety for the king, but if the king shoots the arrow downwards, the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends.’
'May there be safety, reverend sir, may there be safety for the king, may there be safety for the land!'
‘There will be safety for the king, there will be safety for the land, but if the king shoots the arrow upwards, as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years.’
'May there be safety, reverend sir, may there be safety for the king, may there be safety for the land, and may the god send rain!'
‘There will be safety for the king, there will be safety for the land, and the god will send rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be completely safe.’
Then, youths, the ministers announced to Okkāka: 'Let Okkāka point the arrow at the crown prince.
The prince will be perfectly safe!'
Then King Okkāka pointed the arrow at the crown prince, and the prince was safe. he became perfectly safe.

Then King Okkāka, terrified and fearful, his hair standing on end, gave his daughter Maddarūpī, who was tormented by divine punishment (*brahmadaṇḍa*).

"Do not, young men, disparage Ambaṭṭha too much by calling him the son of a slave girl. That Kaṇha was a mighty seer!"

The superiority of the noble (*kṣatriya*)

275.

Then the Blessed One addressed the youth Ambaṭṭha: "What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? If a noble youth were to cohabit with a *brāhmaṇa* maiden, and a son were born to them,

would that son of a noble youth and a *brāhmaṇa* maiden receive a seat or water among the *brāhmaṇas*?" "He would receive it, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* allow him to eat at a funeral feast (*śraddha*), a ceremonial milk-rice offering (*thālipāka*), a sacrifice (*yajña*), or as a guest (*pāhuna*)?" "They would allow him, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* teach him *mantras* or not?" "They would teach him, venerable Gotama."

"Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?" "Uncovered, venerable Gotama."

"Would nobles consecrate him with the consecration of a noble?" "No, venerable Gotama."

"What is the reason for that?" "Because he is not well-born on his mother’s side, venerable Gotama."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? If a *brāhmaṇa* youth were to cohabit with a noble maiden, and a son were born to them,

would that son of a *brāhmaṇa* youth and a noble maiden receive a seat or water among the *brāhmaṇas*?" "He would receive it, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* allow him to eat at a funeral feast (*śraddha*), a ceremonial milk-rice offering (*thālipāka*), a sacrifice (*yajña*), or as a guest (*pāhuna*)?" "They would allow him, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* teach him *mantras* or not?" "They would teach him, venerable Gotama."

"Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?" "Uncovered, venerable Gotama."

"Would nobles consecrate him with the consecration of a noble?" "No, venerable Gotama."

"What is the reason for that?" "Because he is not well-born on his father’s side, venerable Gotama."

276.

"Thus, Ambaṭṭha, whether it is a woman taking a woman or a man taking a man, the nobles (*kṣatriyas*) are superior, and the *brāhmaṇas* are inferior.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? If *brāhmaṇas* were to shave the head of a *brāhmaṇa* for some reason,

sprinkle him with ashes, and banish him from the country or the city,

would he receive a seat or water among the *brāhmaṇas*?" "No, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* allow him to eat at a funeral feast (*śraddha*), a ceremonial milk-rice offering (*thālipāka*), a sacrifice (*yajña*), or as a guest (*pāhuna*)?" "No, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* teach him *mantras* or not?" "No, venerable Gotama."

"Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?" "Covered, venerable Gotama."

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? If nobles (*kṣatriyas*) were to shave the head of a noble (*kṣatriya*) for some reason, sprinkle him with ashes, and banish him from the country or the city,

would he receive a seat or water among the *brāhmaṇas*?" "He would receive it, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* allow him to eat at a funeral feast (*śraddha*), a ceremonial milk-rice offering (*thālipāka*), a sacrifice (*yajña*), or as a guest (*pāhuna*)?" "They would allow him, venerable Gotama."

"Would the *brāhmaṇas* teach him *mantras* or not?" "They would teach him, venerable Gotama."

"Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?" "Uncovered, venerable Gotama."

277.

"To this extent, Ambaṭṭha, a noble (*kṣatriya*) can reach the lowest degradation: when nobles shave his head, sprinkle him with ashes, and banish him from the country or the city.

Thus, Ambaṭṭha, even when a noble (*kṣatriya*) has reached the lowest degradation, the nobles (*kṣatriyas*) are still superior, and the *brāhmaṇas* are inferior.

This verse was spoken by Brahmā Sanankumāra, Ambaṭṭha [or, Ambaṭṭha, this was sent by Brahmā, Ambaṭṭha]:

‘The *kṣatriya* is best among those who value lineage;

He is endowed with knowledge and conduct,
He is the best of gods and humans."
"That verse, Ambaṭṭha, was well sung, not ill-sung, by Brahmā Sanankumāra; well spoken, not ill-spoken; connected with meaning, not without meaning; and approved by me.
And I too, Ambaṭṭha, say this: The Khattiya is the best among those who value clan.
He with knowledge and conduct,
is best of gods and men."
The first section for recitation is finished.
The Discourse on Knowledge and Conduct.
278.
"What, Master Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "Ambattha, with the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, there is no talk of lineage or clan or pride, saying, 'You are worthy of me, or you are not worthy of me.'
For wherever, Ambattha, there is a giving or taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit, this talk of lineage, clan, or pride, saying, 'You are worthy of me, or you are not worthy of me.'
But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct.
By abandoning attachment to lineage, clan and pride, the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct is realized."
279.
"What, Master Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "Here, Ambattha, the Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arhat, a Fully Enlightened One, endowed with understanding and good conduct, the Happy One, the Knower of the Worlds, the unsurpassed Trainer of those who can be trained, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed One.
He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people.
He preaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the spirit and in the letter; He reveals the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure.
A householder or a householder's son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma.
Having heard this Dhamma,
he gains faith in the Tathagata.
Being endowed with faith in the Tathagata, he reflects thus…pe… (as in 191 and the following uninterrupted passages, so it is to be set forth in full).
…
"Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation… and this is part of his conduct.
"Again, Ambattha, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, the monk enters & remains in the second *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance… and this is part of his conduct.
"And further, Ambattha, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding’… and this is part of his conduct.
"And further, Ambattha, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—the monk enters & remains in the fourth *jhāna*: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain… and this is part of his conduct.
This, Ambattha, is conduct.
"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, spotless, with the defilements gone, supple, workable, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision…pe… 'There is nothing further for this state of being,' he understands; this is part of his knowledge.
This, Ambattha, is knowledge.
"This, Ambattha, is what is called a monk accomplished in knowledge, accomplished in conduct, accomplished in knowledge and conduct.
And beyond this accomplishment of knowledge and conduct, Ambattha, there is no other accomplishment of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more sublime."
Four Paths of Failure
280.
"But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct there are four paths of failure.
What are the four? Here, Ambattha, some ascetic or Brahmin, without attaining to this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, Dīghanikāyo

Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.

Brahmajāla Sutta
The Discourse about the Wanderers
1.
Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was travelling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda with a large Saṅgha of monks, with about five hundred monks.
Suppiya the wandering ascetic was also travelling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda, together with his student Brahmadatta, a young man.
There, Suppiya the wandering ascetic, in many ways, spoke in dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dharma, spoke in dispraise of the Saṅgha. But Brahmadatta, the student of Suppiya the wandering ascetic, in many ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in praise of the Dharma, spoke in praise of the Saṅgha.
Thus, these two, teacher and student, directly contradicting each other's assertions, followed closely behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of monks.
2.
Then, the Blessed One stopped for one night at the royal rest house in Ambalaṭṭhika, together with the Saṅgha of monks.
Suppiya the wandering ascetic also stopped for one night at the royal rest house in Ambalaṭṭhika, together with his student Brahmadatta, a young man.
There, too, Suppiya the wandering ascetic, in many ways... Having applied myself to exertion ( *padhāna*), having applied myself to concentration ( *anuyoga*), having applied myself to diligence ( *appamāda*), having applied myself to proper attention ( *sammāmanasikāra*), I attain to such a state of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that, with my mind thus concentrated, I recall my various past lives. That is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many hundreds of births, many thousands of births, many hundreds of thousands of births. ‘There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was such-and-such, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away thence, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away thence, I arose here.’

Thus, with their aspects and particulars, I recollect my manifold past lives (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarāmi*).

That is how I know this: "The self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same, just like eternity itself."

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the first way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*).
32.
"And on what grounds, friends (*bhonto*), do other ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*)? Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), some ascetic or Brahmin, by means of ardour, exertion (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated, he recollects his numerous past lives (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati*).

That is, one aeon of world-contraction and expansion, throughout two, three, four, five, or ten aeons of world-contraction and expansion. ‘Then I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I arose here.’

Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati*). He speaks thus: ‘The self (*ātman*) and the world are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭha*), standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.’

What is the reason for that? Because I, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with my mind thus concentrated, I recollect my numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*) in their modes and their details.

That is to say, one period of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭa*), two periods of contraction and expansion, three periods of contraction and expansion, four periods of contraction and expansion, five periods of contraction and expansion, ten periods of contraction and expansion.

"There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, my food was so-and-so, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span. Passing away from there, I arose there. There too, my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, my food was so-and-so, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here."

Thus, with their aspects and particulars, I recollect my manifold past lives.

For this reason I know this: the self (*ātman*) and the world are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭha*), standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.’

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the second ground, based on which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self (*ātman*) and the world.

33.

"But what is the third ground, based on which, venerable monks (*bhonto* *samaṇabrāhmaṇā*), ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self (*ātman*) and the world? Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), some ascetic (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*), by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with their mind thus concentrated, they recollect their numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*).

That is to say, ten periods of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭa*), twenty periods of contraction and expansion, thirty periods of contraction and expansion, forty periods of contraction and expansion: ‘There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, my food was so-and-so, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span. Passing away from there, I arose there. There too, my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, my food was so-and-so, such was my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’

Thus, with their aspects and particulars, they recollect their manifold past lives. And he says: “The self ( *attā*) and the world ( *loko*) are eternal ( *sassato*), barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar (*esikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*). And though these beings (*sattā*) roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself (*atthitveva sassatisamaṃ*)."

For what reason is that? Because I, by means of ardour (*ātappaṃ*), endeavour (*padhānaṃ*), application (*anuyogaṃ*), diligence (*appamādaṃ*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāraṃ*), attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhiṃ*) that with my mind ( *citte*) thus concentrated (*yathāsamāhite*), I recollect my numerous past lives (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarāmi*).

that is, ten, twenty, thirty, forty periods of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭāni*)—‘There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, such was my appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I arose in such and such a place. There too my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, such was my appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’

In this way, with their aspects (*sākāraṃ*) and particulars (*sauddesaṃ*), I remember my manifold past existences (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarāmi*).

That is how I know the self ( *attā*) and the world ( *loko*) are eternal ( *sassato*), barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar (*esikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*). And though these beings (*sattā*) roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself (*atthitveva sassatisamaṃ*).’

This, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), is the third case ( *tatiyaṃ ṭhānaṃ*), on account of which, with reference to which, some ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) are eternalists (*sassatavādā*), proclaiming the self ( *attānaṃ*) and the world ( *lokaṃ*) to be eternal ( *sassataṃ*).

34.

“In the fourth case, venerable monks and brahmins (*bhonto samaṇabrāhmaṇā*), due to what, with reference to what, are the eternalists (*sassatavādā*) proclaiming the self (*attānaṃ*) and the world (*lokaṃ*) to be eternal (*sassataṃ*)? Here, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), some ascetic (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*) is a logician (*takkī*), a reasoner (*vīmaṃsī*). He declares his view—hammered out by reason (*takkapariyāhataṃ*), deduced from his investigations (*vīmaṃsānucaritaṃ*), following his own flight of thought (*sayaṃ paṭibhānaṃ*)—thus: ‘The self ( *attā*) and the world ( *loko*) are eternal ( *sassato*), barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar (*esikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*). And though these beings (*sattā*) roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself (*atthitveva sassatisamaṃ*)’."

This, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), is the fourth case ( *catutthaṃ ṭhānaṃ*), on account of which, with reference to which, some ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) are eternalists (*sassatavādā*), proclaiming the self ( *attānaṃ*) and the world ( *lokaṃ*) to be eternal ( *sassataṃ*).

35.

“It is on these four grounds (*catūhi vatthūhi*), mendicants (*bhikkhave*), that those recluses and brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*) proclaim the self (*attānañca*) and the world (*lokañca*) to be eternal ( *sassataṃ*).

Whatever recluses or brahmins (*samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā*) there may be who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*) and proclaim the self (*attānañca*) and the world (*lokañca*) to be eternal (*sassataṃ*), all of them do so on these four grounds (*catūhi vatthūhi*) or on a certain one (*aññatarena*) of them. Outside of these there is none (*natthi ito bahiddhā*).

36.

“This, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), the Tathāgata (*tathāgato*) understands (*pajānāti*). And he understands: ‘These standpoints (*diṭṭhiṭṭhānā*), thus assumed (*evaṃgahitā*) and thus misapprehended (*evaṃparāmaṭṭhā*), lead to such a future destination (*evaṃgatikā*), to such a state in the world beyond (*evaṃabhisamparāyā*)’. This the Tathāgata (*tathāgato*) knows (*pajānāti*), and what transcends (*uttaritaraṃ*) this he knows (*pajānāti*); and that understanding (*pajānanaṃ*) he does not grasp at (*na parāmasati*), and because he does not grasp, he has realised within himself (*paccattaññeva*) perfect peace (*nibbuti viditā*).

Having understood as they really are (*yathābhūtaṃ viditvā*) the origin (*samudayaṃ*), the passing away (*atthaṅgamaṃ*), the satisfaction (*assādaṃ*), the unsatisfactoriness (*ādīnavaṃ*), and the escape (*nissaraṇaṃ*) of feelings (*vedanānaṃ*), the Tathāgata (*tathāgato*), mendicants (*bhikkhave*), is emancipated (*anupādāvimutto*) through non-clinging (*anupādā*).

37.

“These, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), are those teachings (*dhammā*) that are deep (*gambhīrā*), difficult to see (*duddasā*), difficult to understand (*duranubodhā*), peaceful (*santā*), sublime (*paṇītā*), beyond the sphere of reasoning (*atakkāvacarā*), subtle (*nipuṇā*), comprehensible only to the wise (*paṇḍitavedanīyā*), which the Tathāgata (*tathāgato*), having realized for himself (*sayaṃ*) with direct knowledge (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), propounds (*pavedeti*), and about which those who would rightly (*sammā*) praise (*vadamānā vadeyyuṃ*) the Tathāgata (*tathāgatassa*) in accordance with reality (*yathābhuccaṃ vaṇṇaṃ*) would speak.

The first recitation section. (*paṭhamabhāṇavāro*)

Partial-eternalism (*ekaccasassatavādo*)

38.

“There are, mendicants (*bhikkhave*), some ascetics and Brahmins (*eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists in regard to some things (*ekaccasassatikā*) and non-eternalists in regard to other things (*ekaccaasassatikā*), and who proclaim the self (*attānañca*) and the world (*lokañca*) to be partly eternal (*ekaccaṃ sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*ekaccaṃ asassataṃ*) on four grounds (*catūhi vatthūhi*).

And venerable mendicants (*bhonto*), due to what, with reference to what, do those ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists in regard to some things (*ekaccasassatikā*) and non-eternalists in regard to other things (*ekaccaasassatikā*) proclaim the self (*attānañca*) and the world (*lokañca*) to be partly eternal (*ekaccaṃ sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*ekaccaṃ asassataṃ*) on four grounds (*catūhi vatthūhi*)?

39.

“There comes a time (*samayo*), mendicants (*bhikkhave*), when after the lapse of a long period (*dīghassa addhuno accayena*) this world (*ayaṃ loko*) contracts (*saṃvaṭṭati*).

While the world (*loke*) is contracting (*saṃvaṭṭamāne*), beings (*sattā*) for the most part (*yebhuyyena*) are reborn in the Ābhassara Brahma-world (*ābhassarasaṃvattanikā honti*).

And there they dwell (*tattha honti*), mind-made (*manomayā*), feeding on delight (*pītibhakkhā*), self-luminous (*sayaṃpabhā*), moving through the air (*antalikkhacarā*), glorious (*subhaṭṭhāyino*)—and they stay (*tiṭṭhanti*) like that for a very long time (*ciraṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ*).

“But sooner or later (*kadāci karahaci*), mendicants (*bhikkhave*), after the lapse of a long period (*dīghassa addhuno accayena*) there comes a time (*samayo*) when this world (*ayaṃ loko*) begins to expand (*vivaṭṭati*).

In this expanding world (*vivaṭṭamāne loke*) an empty palace of Brahmā (*suññaṃ brahmavimānaṃ*) appears (*pātubhavati*).

Then a certain being (*aññataro satto*), due to the exhaustion of his life-span (*āyukkhayā*) or the exhaustion of his merit (*puññakkhayā*), passes away (*cavitvā*) from the Ābhassara plane (*ābhassarakāyā*) and re-arises (*upapajjati*) in the empty palace of Brahmā (*suññaṃ brahmavimānaṃ*). There he dwells, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And he continues thus for a long, long period of time.
41.

“Then, as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time, there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation, : ‘Oh, that other beings might come to this place!’
And other beings, from exhaustion of their life-span or of their merits, fall from the Ābhassara world and arise in the Brahma- palace as companions for this being.
There they dwell, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And they continue thus for a long, long period of time.
42.

“Thereupon the being who re-arose there first thinks to himself: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be.
These beings were created by me.
Why is that? Because first I made the wish: “Oh, that other beings might come to this place!”
That was my wish, and then these beings came into this existence!”
“And the beings who re-arose there after him also think: ‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be.
We were created by him.
Why is that? We have seen that he was here first, and we appeared here after him.”
43.

“Herein, *bhikkhus*, the being who re-arose there first possesses longer life, greater beauty, and greater authority than the beings who re-arose there after him.
But those beings who arose subsequently possess shorter life, less beauty, and less authority.
44.

“And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.
Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.
Having gone forth from the household life, he,
by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life, but none previous to that.
He speaks thus: ‘We were created by him, by Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and he will remain the same just like eternity itself.
But we who were created by that Brahmā, we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, fated to fall away, and we have come to this world.”
This, *bhikkhus*, is the first case where by some ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly Non-Eternalists.
45.

“In the second case, owing to what, with reference to what, do some honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views? There are, *bhikkhus*, gods called the Sport-Addicted. They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.
They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment, so that their mindfulness is dissipated,
and by the dissipation of mindfulness those beings fall from that state.
46.

“And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.
Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.
Having gone forth from the household life, he, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life, but none previous to that.
He speaks thus: ‘Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by play do not spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.
Thus their mindfulness is not dissipated, And because they are not forgetful ( *satiyā asammosā*), those gods do not fall from that state. They are permanent ( *niccā*), stable ( *dhuvā*), eternal ( *sassatā*), not subject to change ( *avipariṇāmadhammā*), and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted by play ( *khiḍḍāpadosikā*), spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.

They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment, so that their mindfulness is dissipated.

When we became forgetful ( *satiyā sammosā*) we passed away from that plane. Coming to this world, now we are impermanent ( *aniccā*), unstable ( *addhuvā*), short-lived ( *appāyukā*), doomed to perish (*cavanadhammā*), and we have come to this world ( *itthattaṃ āgatā’ti*).’

This, monks ( *bhikkhave*), is the second case, whereby some ascetics and Brahmins, are partly Eternalists (*ekaccasassatikā*) and partly Non-Eternalists (*ekaccaasassatikā*), propound partly eternal (*ekaccaṃ sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*ekaccaṃ asassataṃ*) views about the self ( *attānaṃ*) and the world ( *lokaṃ*).

47.

"And in the third case, venerable monks, what do some ascetics and Brahmins rely on, what do they take as their starting point, to propound partly eternal and partly non-eternal views about the self and the world? There are, monks, gods called 'corrupted by mind' ( *manopadosikā*). They contemplate each other with excessive envy.

By this means their minds are corrupted.

On account of their corrupted minds they become weary in body and mind.

And they fall from that place.

48.

"And it may happen, monks, that a certain being ( *satto*) falls from that state and arises in this world ( *itthattaṃ āgacchati*).

Having arisen in this world ( *itthattaṃ āgato*), he goes forth from the household life ( *agārasmā*) into homelessness ( *anagāriyaṃ pabbajati*).

Having gone forth from home to homelessness, by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention, he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life ( *pubbenivāsaṃ*), but none previous to that.

He speaks thus: ‘Those honourable gods who are not corrupted by mind ( *na manopadosikā*), do not contemplate each other with excessive envy.

As a result, their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another.

They are not corrupted in mind, or weary in body and mind.

And they do not pass away from that plane. Those gods are permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted by mind ( *manopadosikā*), contemplated each other with excessive envy.

And as a result our minds became corrupted by anger towards one another. When our minds were corrupted by anger, our bodies and minds became exhausted.

Thus we have fallen from that state, we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, doomed to perish, and we have come to this world. And after I made this resolution,
This, monks, is the third case. It is owing to this, with reference to this, that some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal, being partly Eternalists and partly Non-Eternalists.
49.
“In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and *brāhmaṇas* partly Eternalists and partly Non-Eternalists, proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal? Here, monks, some ascetic or *brāhmaṇa* is a reasoner and an investigator.

He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: ‘That which is called “the eye” ( *cakṣu*), “the ear” (*śrotam*), “the nose” (*ghānam*), “the tongue” (*jihvā*), and “the body” (*kāya*)—that self is impermanent (*anicca*), unstable (*addhuva*), non-eternal (*asassata*), subject to change (*vipariṇāmadhamma*).

But that which is called “mind” (*citta*) or “mentality” (*mano*) or “consciousness” (*vijñāṇa*)—that self is permanent (*nicca*), stable (*dhuva*), eternal (*sassata*), not subject to change (*avipariṇāmadhamma*), and it will remain the same just like eternity itself.’

This, monks, is the fourth case. It is owing to this, with reference to this, that some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal, being partly Eternalists and partly Non-Eternalists.
50.
“It is on these four grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who are partial-eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.

Whatever ascetics and Brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal, all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.
51.
“This, monks, the *Tathāgata* understands. And he understands: ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.’

He understands as well what transcends this, yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend. And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nirvṛti*).

Having understood as they really are the origin (*samudaya*) and the passing away (*atthaṅgama*) of feelings, their satisfaction (*assāda*), their unsatisfactoriness (*ādīnava*), and the escape (*nissaraṇa*) from them, the *Tathāgata*, monks, is emancipated through non-clinging.
52.
“These, monks, are those *dharmas* that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*

having realized for himself with direct knowledge (*abhiññā*), propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.
The doctrine of Finitism and Infinitism (*antānantavāda*)
53.
“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are extensionists, and who on four grounds proclaim the world to be finite or infinite.

And owing to what, with reference to what, do those honourable ascetics and Brahmins who are extensionists proclaim the world to be finite or infinite on four grounds?
54.
“Herein, monks, a certain recluse or a *brāhmaṇa*, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavour (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite (*antasaññī*).

He speaks thus: ‘The world is finite (*antavā*) and bounded by a circle (*parivaṭumo*).

What is the reason for that? Because I, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attain to such a degree of mental concentration that with my mind thus concentrated I abide perceiving the world as finite.

For that reason I know this: the world is finite and bounded by a circle.’

This, monks, is the first case where some ascetics and Brahmins, relying on it and with reference to it, are extensionists, proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite.
55.
“And in the second case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and Brahmins extensionists, proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite? Herein, monks, a certain recluse or a *brāhmaṇa*, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as infinite (*anantasaññī*).

He speaks thus: ‘The world is infinite and boundless (*apariyanto*).

Those ascetics and Brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely;
The world is infinite and boundless.
What is the reason for that? Because I, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attain to such a degree of mental concentration I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as infinite.
Therefore I know that this world is infinite and unbounded.
This, mendicants, is the second case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, taking it up, they proclaim the world to be finite and infinite.
56.
“And what is the third case? Relying on what, taking up what, do some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the world to be finite and infinite? Here, mendicants, some ascetic or Brahmin attains to such concentration of mind, having applied themselves to ardour, endeavour, devotion, diligence, and proper attention, that they abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
“He speaks thus: ‘The world is both finite and infinite.’
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: ‘The world is finite and bounded’ are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: ‘The world is infinite and unbounded’ are also wrong.
The world is both finite and infinite.
Why is that? Because I attain to such concentration of mind, having applied myself to ardour, endeavour, devotion, diligence, and proper attention, that I abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
Therefore I know that the world is both finite and infinite.
This, mendicants, is the third case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, taking it up, they proclaim the world to be finite and infinite.
57.
“And what is the fourth case? Relying on what, taking up what, do some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the world to be finite and infinite? Here, mendicants, some ascetic or Brahmin is a logician and reasoner.
Relying on logic, following reason, he declares his own idea thus: ‘The world is neither finite nor infinite.’
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: ‘The world is finite and bounded’ are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: ‘The world is infinite and unbounded’ are also wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: ‘The world is both finite and infinite’ are also wrong.
The world is neither finite nor infinite.’
This, mendicants, is the fourth case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, taking it up, they proclaim the world to be finite and infinite.
58.
“It is by these four grounds that those ascetics and Brahmins, who are extensionists, proclaim the world to be finite or infinite.
Whatever ascetics or Brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite, all of them do so on these four grounds, or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.
59.
“This, mendicants, the *Tathāgata* understands: ‘These viewpoints, when assumed and misunderstood in this way, lead to such and such a destination in the world beyond.’
The *Tathāgata* understands this, and he understands what transcends it. And he does not misapprehend that understanding, and so he has realized extinguishment for himself.
Having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings, their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them, the *Tathāgata*, mendicants, is liberated without remainder.
60.
“These, mendicants, are the *dharmas* that are deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata* makes known, having realized them with his own insight; those who praise the *Tathāgata* rightly praising in accordance with reality would speak of them.
The doctrine of eel-wrigglers.
61.
“There are, mendicants, some ascetics and Brahmins who are eel-wrigglers. When questioned about this or that matter, they resort to evasive statements, wriggling like eels on four grounds.
Relying on what, taking up what, do those ascetics and Brahmins become eel-wrigglers? When questioned about this or that matter, they resort to evasive statements, wriggling like eels on four grounds?
62.
“Here, mendicants, some ascetic or Brahmin doesn’t truly know what is skillful and what is unskillful.
He thinks: ‘I don’t truly know what is skillful and what is unskillful.’
And if I "This is skillful" without truly understanding, "this is unskillful" without truly understanding, I might declare 'this is skillful' or I might declare 'this is unskillful,' that would be a lie for me.
If my declaration should be false, that would distress me.
And if I were distressed, that would be an obstacle for me.

Thus, fearing falsehood and loathing falsehood, he does not declare this to be *kusala* (skillful/wholesome), nor does he declare this to be *akusala* (unskillful/unwholesome). When questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and endless equivocation: "I don't say it is thus; neither do I say it is that way; nor do I say it is some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that."

This, *bhikkhus* (monks), is the first basis, because of which some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (Brahmins), being eel-wrigglers, when questioned on various points, resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation.
63.
"And furthermore, *bhonto* (Venerable sirs), what is the basis, what is the reason, that some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas*, being eel-wrigglers, when questioned on various points, resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation? Here, *bhikkhus*, some ascetic or *brāhmaṇa* does not truly understand 'this is *kusala*' (skillful/wholesome), nor does he truly understand 'this is *akusala*' (unskillful/unwholesome).

He thinks: 'I do not truly know what is *kusala* (skillful/wholesome), and I do not truly know what is *akusala* (unskillful/unwholesome).

If, without understanding, I were to declare something to be *kusala* (skillful/wholesome) or *akusala* (unskillful/unwholesome), desire, lust, hatred, or aversion might arise in me.

Should desire, lust, hatred, or aversion arise in me, that would be *upādāna* (clinging/attachment) on my part.

If I felt *upādāna* (clinging/attachment), that would distress me.

And if I were distressed, that would be an obstacle for me."

Thus, fearing *upādāna* (clinging/attachment) and loathing *upādāna* (clinging/attachment), he does not declare this to be *kusala* (skillful/wholesome), nor does he declare this to be *akusala* (unskillful/unwholesome). When questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and endless equivocation: "I don't say it is thus; neither do I say it is that way; nor do I say it is some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that."

This, *bhikkhus*, is the second basis, because of which some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas*. Endless equivocators, when questioned about this or that point, resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation.

64.
"In the third case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and *brāhmaṇas* endless equivocators, resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation? Here, *bhikkhus*, a certain recluse or a *brāhmaṇa* does not understand as it really is what is *kuśala* (wholesome), does not understand as it really is what is *akuśala* (unwholesome).

He thinks: ‘I do not in truth know whether this is *kuśala* (good) or whether it is *akuśala* (bad).’

If, without understanding as it really is what is *kuśala* (wholesome), without understanding as it really is what is *akuśala* (unwholesome), I might declare: ‘That is *kuśala* (good)’, or ‘That is *akuśala* (bad)’.

Now, there are *śramaṇas* (ascetics) and *brāhmaṇas* who are wise, clever, experienced in controversy, like archers who can split hairs, who go around demolishing the views of others with their wisdom. If they should cross-examine me, demanding my reasons and arguing with me.

If they should cross-examine me, demanding my reasons and arguing, I might not be able to reply.

Not being able to reply would distress me.

and that distress would be an obstacle for me.’

Therefore, out of fear and loathing of being cross-examined, he does not declare anything to be *kuśala* (wholesome) or *akuśala* (unwholesome). But, when questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.’

This, *bhikkhus*, is the third case, owing to which, with reference to which, some *śramaṇas* (ascetics) and *brāhmaṇas* are endless equivocators, when questioned about this or that point, resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation.

65.
"In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable *śramaṇas* (ascetics) and *brāhmaṇas* endless equivocators, resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation? Here, *bhikkhus*, a certain *śramaṇa* (ascetic) or *brāhmaṇa* is dull and stupid.

Due to his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: ‘If you ask me whether there is *para loka* (a world beyond)...’ If I thought so, I would declare, "There is another world." But I don’t say so. And I don’t say otherwise. And I don’t say it is not, and I don’t not say it is not.

‘There is no other world… and so on… ‘There both is and is not another world… and so on… ‘There neither is nor is not another world… and so on… ‘There are beings who are spontaneously born… and so on… ‘There are no beings who are spontaneously born… and so on… ‘There both are and are not beings who are spontaneously born… and so on… ‘There neither are nor are not beings who are spontaneously born… and so on… ‘There is fruit and result of good and bad actions ( *sukata-duukkaṭānaṃ kammaṇaṃ phalaṃ vipāko*)… and so on… ‘There is no fruit and result of good and bad actions… and so on… ‘There both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad actions… and so on… ‘There neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad actions… and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* exists after death… and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* does not exist after death… and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* both exists and does not exist after death… and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ If you ask me, ‘The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death,’ if I thought so, I would declare, ‘The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ But I don’t say so. And I don’t say otherwise. And I don’t say it is not, and I don’t not say it is not.

This, *bhikkhus*, is the fourth case, on which these ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* who are eel-wrigglers, when questioned on various points, resort to evasive statements and wriggle like eels.

66.

"It is by these four grounds, *bhikkhus*, that those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* who are eel-wrigglers, when questioned on various points, resort to evasive statements and wriggle like eels.

Whatever ascetics or *brāhmaṇas* there may be who are eel-wrigglers, when questioned on various points, resort to evasive statements and wriggle like eels, all of them do so by these very four grounds, or by one or another of them; there is nothing outside of these… and so on… that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of chance origination.

67.

"There are, *bhikkhus*, some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* who are chance-originationists, who proclaim the chance origin of the self (*ātman*) and the world on two grounds.

And those venerable ones... following closely behind the company of monks."
"This, venerable sir, was the discussion that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived."

“If, monks, others should speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart.
If, monks, others should speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, and you were to be angry or displeased, that would only be a hindrance to you.
If, monks, others should speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, and you were to be angry or displeased, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?” “No, venerable sir.”
“If, monks, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, then you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying: ‘That is incorrect, that is false, that is not our way, that is not found among us.’”

“If, monks, others should speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart.
If, monks, others should speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, and you were to be pleased, happy or elated, that would only be a hindrance to you.
If others praise me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, you should acknowledge the truth of what is true, saying: “That is correct, that is right, that is our way, that is found among us.”
Cūḷasīlaṃ

“It is, monks, only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue (sīla), that a worldling (puthujjana) would refer when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.
And what are those trifling and insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue (sīla), to which he would refer? What is the cause, what is the reason, that some recluses and brahmins are fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously, based on two grounds?

68.
"There are, bhikkhus, certain gods called 'non-percipient beings.'

As soon as a perception arises in them, those gods pass away from that plane.

And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls the arising of perception, but recalls none before that.

He speaks thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

What is the reason for that? Because previously I did not exist, but now I am. Not having been, I sprang into being.”

This, bhikkhus, is the first reason, why some recluses and brahmins are fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

69.
"And in the second case, bhikkhus, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously? Here, bhikkhus, some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist, an investigator.

He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

This, bhikkhus, is the second reason, why some recluses and brahmins are fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

70.
"It is on these two grounds, bhikkhus, that those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously, all of them do so on these two grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none… and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

71.
"It is on these eighteen grounds, bhikkhus, that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and hold settled views about the past assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past.

…on eighteen grounds.

Whatever recluses or brahmins are speculators about the past, hold settled views about the past, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past, all of them do so on these eighteen grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.

72.
"This, bhikkhus, the *Tathāgata* understands: ‘These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such-and-such destinations in another world.

This the *Tathāgata* knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace,

and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings, their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them, the *Tathāgata* is liberated without remainder.

73.
"These are those *dhammas*, bhikkhus, that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The second recitation section .

Speculators about the future

74.
"There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future, who hold settled views about the future, and who on forty-four grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future.

…on forty-four grounds.

And what is the cause, what is the reason, that those honourable recluses and brahmins, being speculators about the future, holding fixed views about the future, assert various conceptual theorems concerning the future relating to the future on forty-four grounds?

The doctrine of percipient immortality

75.
"There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality and who on sixteen grounds proclaim the self to survive percipient after death. And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, relying on what, starting with what, do they propound the self as conscious after death, in sixteen ways?

76.

“The self is material, healthy, conscious after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is immaterial, healthy, conscious after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is both material and immaterial… neither material nor immaterial… finite… infinite… both finite and infinite… neither finite nor infinite… of uniform perception… of diversified perception… of limited perception… of boundless perception… exclusively happy… exclusively miserable.

The self is both happy and miserable.

The self is neither happy nor miserable, healthy, conscious after death,” they proclaim.

77.

The doctrine of non-percipient immortality

78.

“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of non-percipient immortality and who on eight grounds proclaim the self to survive non-percipient after death.

And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, relying on what, starting with what, do they propound the self as non-percipient after death, in eight ways?

79.

“The self is material, healthy, non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is immaterial, healthy, non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is both material and immaterial… neither material nor immaterial… finite… infinite… both finite and infinite… neither finite nor infinite, healthy, non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

The doctrine of annihilation

84.

“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are annihilationists and who on seven grounds proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

And “Venerable recluses and brahmins, relying on what, based on what, do you proclaim the annihilationist doctrine, the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being on seven grounds?”

85.

“Here, monks, a certain recluse or Brahmin declares and holds the view: ‘Since this self, good sir, has material form, is composed of the four great elements, originates from father and mother, it is annihilated and perishes at the breaking-up of the body, and does not exist after death. This is the way in which this self is completely annihilated." ( kāyassa bhedā ucchijjati vinassati, na hoti paraṃ maraṇā, ettāvatā kho, bho, ayaṃ attā sammā samucchinno hotī’ti )

In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

86.

"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated. For there is another self, divine, having material form, pertaining to the sense sphere, feeding on edible nutriment. You don’t know it or see it, but I do. Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’

In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

87.

"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated. For there is another self—divine, having material form, mind-made, complete in all its limbs and organs, not destitute of any faculties. You don’t know it or see it, but I do. Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’

In this way some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

88.

"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated. For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of infinite space, the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form, by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, by non-attention to perceptions of diversity, “Space is infinite." You don’t know it or see it, but I do. Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’

In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

89.

"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated. For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness, completely surmounting the base of infinite space : “Consciousness is infinite.” You don’t know it or see it, but I do. Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’

In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

90.

"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated. For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of nothingness, completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness : “There is nothing.” You don’t know it or see it, but I do.
It is this self, good sir, that is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body, and does not exist after death; at this point, the self is completely annihilated.
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and non-existence of an existent being.
91.
Another says to him: "There is, good sir, such a self as you say; I do not say that it does not exist; but that self is not wholly annihilated at that point.
For there is another, good sir, For there is another self which, by entirely transcending the base of nothingness and thinking, "This is peaceful, this is sublime," has attained to the base of neither perception nor non-perception.

That you neither know nor see.

But I know it and see it.

It is this self that, at the breaking up of the body, is annihilated and destroyed, and does not exist after death. At this point, the self is completely annihilated.

That is how some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

92.

"It is on these grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who are annihilationists proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being in seven ways.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being, all of them do so on these seven grounds… and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of *Nibbāna* here and now.

93.

"There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of *Nibbāna* here and now and who, on five grounds, proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.

And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, based on what, relying on what, who are proclaimers of *Nibbāna* here and now, proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being in five ways?

94.

"Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin declares and holds the view: “In as far as this self, being furnished and endowed with the five strands of sense-pleasures (*kāmaguṇa*), indulges in them, then that is when the self realizes the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”

In this way, some proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.

95.

"Then another says to him: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. But that is not when the self attains the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.

What is the reason for that? Because, good sir, sense pleasures are impermanent, suffering, subject to change, and through their change and transformation there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

But when the self, quite secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and abides in the first *jhāna*, which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusion—at this point, good sir, That is when the self realises the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”
In this way some proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
96.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.
Why is that? Because that jhāna contains initial and sustained thought; therefore it is declared to be gross.
But when the self by the subsiding of thinking and pondering enters and abides in the second *jhāna*, with inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, which is free from thinking and pondering and is bom of concentration, and accompanied by delight and joy, that is when the self realises the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”
In this way some proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
97.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.
Why is that? Because on account of the presence of delight there is mental exhilaration, and that state is considered gross.
But when the self, with the waning of delight, dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware, experiencing in his own body that joy of which the Noble Ones say: ‘Happy dwells one who has equanimity and mindfulness’, and so enters and abides in the third *jhāna*, that is when the self realises the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”
In this way some proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
98.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.
Why is that? It is declared to be gross because a mental concern, ‘Happiness,’ exists there.
But when, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief, one enters and abides in the fourth *jhāna*, which is without pleasure and pain and contains purification of mindfulness through equanimity—at this point, good sir, the self attains the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.
In this way some proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being. 99.
“It is on these five grounds, bhikkhus, that those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of *Nibbāna* here and now proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being. ( *diṭṭhadhammanibbānavādā sato sattassa paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ paññapenti pañcahi vatthūhi*)
Whatever recluses or brahmins, bhikkhus, are proclaimers of *Nibbāna* here and now and who proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being, all of them do so on these five grounds or on a certain one of them…and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

100.
“It is on these forty-four grounds, bhikkhus, that those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future and hold settled views about the future assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future.

101.

Outside of these there is none.

103.
“This, bhikkhus, the *Tathāgata* understands: ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.’
This the *Tathāgata* knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nibbuti*).
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings, their satisfaction, their unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from them, the *Tathāgata*, bhikkhus, is emancipated through non-clinging.

104.
“These are those *dhamma*s, bhikkhus, that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

"When, monks, a monk understands as they really are the arising and passing away of the six bases of contact ( *ṣaṇṇāṃ sparśāyatanānāṃ samudayañca asthaṅgamañca* ), their attraction, their peril, and the deliverance from them, then he understands what transcends all these views.

Whenever they emerge, they emerge caught within this net, trapped and contained within this very net.

"Just as, monks, a skillful fisherman or a fisherman's apprentice might cover a small pool of water with a fine-meshed net,

might think: ‘Whatever sizeable creatures there are in this pool, all are trapped within this net, trapped and contained in this very net’— in the same way, all those recluses and brahmins are trapped in this net with its sixty-two divisions.

"The body ( *kāya* ) of the *Tathāgata*, monks, stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut.

As long as the body subsists, devas and humans will see him.

But at the breaking-up of the body and the exhaustion of the life-span, devas and humans will see him no more.

"Just as, monks, when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut, all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow along with it, in the same way, the body ( *kāya* ) of the *Tathāgata* stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut. As long as his body stands, gods and men shall see him. But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life-faculty, gods and men shall see him no more." 8.
“‘Having abandoned the destruction of life, the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from the destruction of life, without stick (daṇḍa) or sword (śattha), scrupulous, compassionate, trembling for the welfare of all living beings.’ Thus, bhikkhus, the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

19.
"Or he might say: ‘Whereas some recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in running messages and errands, such as for kings (*raññaṃ*), ministers of state (*rājamahāmattānaṃ*), *kṣatriyas* (*khattiyānaṃ*), *brāhmaṇas* (*brāhmaṇānaṃ*), householders (*gahapatikānaṃ*), or youths (*kumārānaṃ*): “Go here, go there, take this, bring that from there”—the recluse *Gotama* abstains from running such messages and errands.’ It is in this way, *bhikkhus*, that a worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

‘“Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: promising gifts to deities in return for favors; fulfilling such promises; demonology; reciting spells after entering an earthen house; inducing virility and impotence; preparing and consecrating sites for a house; giving ceremonial mouthwashes and ceremonial bathing; offering sacrificial fires; administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and enemas; and administering ear-, eye-, and nose- medicines, ointments and counter-ointments; performing eye-surgery and other types of surgery; and practicing pediatrics; providing elixirs prepared from medicinal roots and herbs.” The ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.’ This is how, bhikkhus, a worldling might speak in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

Brahmajāla Sutta
The Discourse about the Wanderers

2.  
Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was travelling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus.

Suppiya the wanderer was also travelling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā with his pupil Brahmadatta, a young man.

There, Suppiya the wanderer, in many ways, spoke in disparagement of the Buddha, spoke in disparagement of the Dharma, spoke in disparagement of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya’s pupil, Brahmadatta the young man, in many ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in praise of the Dharma, spoke in praise of the Saṅgha.

Thus, these two, teacher and pupil, holding directly opposing views, followed behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.

3.  
Then the Blessed One went to the royal rest house in Ambalaṭṭhika, and stayed there for one night with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.

Suppiya the wanderer also went to the royal rest house in Ambalaṭṭhika, and stayed there for one night with his pupil Brahmadatta, a young man.

There, too, Suppiya the wanderer, in many ways, spoke in disparagement of the Buddha, spoke in disparagement of the Dharma, spoke in disparagement of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya’s pupil, Brahmadatta the young man, in many ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in praise of the Dharma, spoke in praise of the Saṅgha.

Thus, these two, teacher and pupil, holding directly opposing views, lived together.

4.  
Then, in the morning, many bhikkhus, having arisen at dawn, gathered together in the round pavilion, and this was the subject that arose in their conversation: “It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous, friends, how well that Blessed One, the knower, the seer, the worthy one, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, understands the variety of inclinations in beings.

This Suppiya the wanderer, in many ways, speaks in disparagement of the Buddha, speaks in disparagement of the Dharma, speaks in disparagement of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya’s pupil, Brahmadatta the young man, in many ways, speaks in praise of the Buddha, speaks in praise of the Dharma, speaks in praise of the Saṅgha.

Thus, these two, teacher and pupil, holding directly opposing views, follow behind the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of bhikkhus."

5.  
Then the Blessed One, knowing the topic of conversation of those bhikkhus, went to the round pavilion, and after arriving, sat down on the prepared seat.

Having sat down, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, “About what topic are you gathered here, bhikkhus? What was the interrupted conversation among you?” When this was said, those bhikkhus said this to the Blessed One: “Here, venerable sir, we, having arisen at dawn, gathered together in the round pavilion, and this was the subject that arose in our conversation: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous, friends, how well that Blessed One, the knower, the seer, the worthy one, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, understands the variety of inclinations in beings.

This Suppiya the wanderer, in many ways, speaks in disparagement of the Buddha, speaks in disparagement of the Dharma, speaks in disparagement of the Saṅgha. But Suppiya’s pupil, Brahmadatta the young man, in many ways, speaks in praise of the Buddha, speaks in praise of the Dharma, speaks in praise of the Saṅgha.

Thus, these two, teacher and pupil, holding directly opposing views, follow behind the Blessed One Through exertion, application, diligence, and right reflection, I attain to such a degree of mental concentration ( *ceto-samādhi*) that with my mind thus concentrated, I recollect my numerous past lives (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*) in their modes and their details. That is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many hundreds of births, many thousands of births, many hundreds of thousands of births: ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I arose here.’

In this way I recollect many past lives (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*) with their characteristics and particulars.

That is how I know the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) remain the same just like eternity itself.’

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the first ground, on which some ascetics (*samaṇa*) and Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*) are based and relying on which they proclaim the eternity (*sassata*) of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*).
32.
"And what, monks (*bhonto*), is the basis and reliance on which other ascetics (*samaṇa*) and Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*) proclaim the eternity (*sassata*) of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*)? Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), some ascetics (*samaṇa*) or Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*), through ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with their mind thus concentrated, they recollect their numerous past lives (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*).

That is to say, one aeon of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭa-vivaṭṭa*), two such periods, three, four, five, ten periods of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭa-vivaṭṭa*)…” “There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life-term. Having passed away from there, I arose there. There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my appearance was so-and-so, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such was my life-term. Having passed away from there, I arose here.”

Thus he remembers various past births (*pūrbbe-nivāsa*), their conditions and details. 7. The Jāliya Discourse
The incident regarding two wanderers

378. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.

Then, at that time, two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and the wanderer Jāliya, the student of the wooden bowl ascetic, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One.

Having exchanged courteous and amiable greetings, they stood to one side.

Standing to one side, those two wanderers said this to the Blessed One: “Friend Gotama, is the soul the same as the body, or is the soul one thing and the body another?”

379. “Then listen, friends, pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, friend,” those two wanderers replied to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One said this: “Here, friend, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhat*, a fully enlightened *Sammāsambuddha*…pe… (as it should be expanded according to sections 190-212).

Thus, friend, a monk is accomplished in virtue…pe…he attains and remains in the first *jhāna*.

That monk who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another?’

That monk who thus knows and thus sees, it is fitting for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’

But I, friend, know and see thus.

And yet, I do not say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’…pe… he attains and remains in the second *jhāna*…pe… the third *jhāna*…pe… the fourth *jhāna*.

That monk who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another?’ That monk who thus knows and thus sees, it is fitting for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’

But I, friend, know and see thus.

And yet, I do not say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’…pe… for the knowledge and vision,

But I, friend, know and see thus.

And yet, I do not say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’…pe….

380. …pe… He understands: ‘There is nothing further here.’

That monk who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another?’ That monk who thus knows and thus sees, it is not fitting for him to say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’

But I, friend, know and see thus.

And yet, I do not say: ‘The soul is the same as the body,’ or ‘The soul is one thing and the body another.’”

This is what the Blessed One said.

Satisfied, those two wanderers rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words.

The Jāliya Discourse, the seventh, is concluded. 8. The Great Lion's Roar Discourse.
The Account of the Naked Ascetic Kassapa.

381. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Uruññā, in the Deer Park at Kaṇṇakatthala.

Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side. Standing to one side, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard it said, venerable Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapa), and censures and blames all those ascetics who lead a harsh life (lūkhājīvi).’”

“Those who say this, venerable Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapa), and censures and blames all those ascetics who lead a harsh life (lūkhājīvi),’ do they speak according to the Blessed Gotama’s words? Do they not accuse the Blessed Gotama falsely? Do they explain the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma? Is there any co-religionist who might deserve to be blamed for this statement? For we do not wish to misrepresent the Blessed Gotama.”

382. “Kassapa, those who say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapa), and censures and blames all those ascetics who lead a harsh life (lūkhājīvi),’ do not speak according to my words; they accuse me falsely, untruthfully.

Here, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who leads a harsh life (lūkhājīviṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā), which is purified beyond the human, I see that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a state of deprivation (apāyaṃ), in an unhappy destination (duggatiṃ), in perdition (vinipātaṃ), in hell (nirayaṃ).

Again, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who leads a harsh life (lūkhājīviṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā), which is purified beyond the human, I see that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a good destination (sugatiṃ), in the heavenly world (saggaṃ lokaṃ).

383. “Here, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who lives with little suffering (appadukkhavihāriṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified beyond the human, I see that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a state of deprivation (apāyaṃ), in an unhappy destination (duggatiṃ), in perdition (vinipātaṃ), in hell (nirayaṃ).

Again, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who lives with little suffering (appadukkhavihāriṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified beyond the human, I see that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a good destination (sugatiṃ), in the heavenly world (saggaṃ lokaṃ).

That I, Kassapa, for these ascetics (tapassīnaṃ), concerning their destination (āgatiñca), their destiny (gatiñca), their decease (cutiñca) and rebirth (upapattiñca), have knowledge as it actually is (yathābhūtaṃ). Since I understand as it truly is the arising, the destiny, the death and re-arising of these ascetics, how could I disapprove of all austerities (tapa), and censure and blame all those ascetics who lead a harsh life (lūkhājīvi) of self-mortification?

384. “Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise (paṇḍita), skilled (nipuṇa), practised in refuting the doctrines of others (kataparappavādā), splitters of hairs (vālavedhirūpā).

They wander about, as it were, demolishing the views (dīṭṭhigatāni) of others with their wisdom (paññāgatena).

Sometimes their views accord with mine, sometimes they do not.

What they sometimes applaud, we also sometimes applaud.

What they sometimes do not applaud, we also sometimes do not applaud.

What they sometimes applaud, we sometimes do not applaud.

What they sometimes do not applaud, we sometimes applaud.

What we sometimes applaud, others also sometimes applaud.

What we sometimes do not applaud, others also sometimes do not applaud.

What we sometimes do not applaud, others sometimes applaud.

What we sometimes applaud, others sometimes do not applaud.

[This is] discussion conducive to questioning.

385. “Then I approach them and say this: ‘In those matters where there is no agreement between us, let those matters stand aside.

In those matters where there is agreement, there let the wise take up, cross-question, and criticise these matters with the teachers (satthārā) or with their followers, saying: ‘Those things of yours, reverends, which are unskilful (akusala), reckoned as unskilful (akusalasaṅkhātā), blameworthy (sāvajja), reckoned as blameworthy (sāvajjasankhātā), not to be cultivated (asevitabbā), reckoned as not to be cultivated (asevitabbasaṅkhātā), not befitting a Noble One (ariya), reckoned as not befitting a Noble One (na alamariyā na alamariyasaṅkhātā), dark (kaṇhā), reckoned as dark (kaṇhasaṅkhātā).

Who is it that has completely abandoned these things, the ascetic Gotama, or some other venerable teachers (gaṇācariyā)?’

386. “Kassapa, it may be that the wise, cross-questioning and criticising, might say: ‘Those things of yours, reverends, which are unskilful (akusala), reckoned as unskilful (akusalasaṅkhātā), blameworthy (sāvajja), reckoned as blameworthy (sāvajjasankhātā), not to be cultivated (asevitabbā), reckoned as not to be cultivated (asevitabbasaṅkhātā), not befitting a Noble One (ariya), reckoned as not befitting a Noble One (na alamariyā na alamariyasaṅkhātā), dark (kaṇhā), reckoned as dark (kaṇhasaṅkhātā).

The ascetic Gotama has completely abandoned these things, or some other venerable teachers (gaṇācariyā).’

Thus it is, Kassapa. ‘In this case, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would give us the greatest share of praise.

387. "Furthermore, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say of the teacher or the Saṅgha: ‘Of those things that are skilled (kusala) and reckoned as such, blameless (anavajja), and reckoned as such, to be practised (sevitabba) and reckoned as such, fitting for a Noble One (alamariya) and reckoned as such, bright (sukka) and reckoned as such.’

Who is there who has completely mastered these things—the ascetic Gotama (Gautama), or some other venerable teachers (gaṇācariyā)?"

388. "It is possible, Kassapa, that the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say this: ‘Of these things that are skilled and reckoned as such, blameless and reckoned as such, to be practiced and reckoned as such, fitting for a Noble One and reckoned as such, bright and reckoned as such,

the ascetic Gotama has completely mastered these things, but the other venerable teachers only in part.’

In this case, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would give us the greatest share of praise.

389. "Furthermore, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say of the teacher or the Saṅgha: ‘Of those things that are unskilful (akusala) and reckoned as such, censurable (sāvajja) and reckoned as such, to be refrained from (asevitabba) and reckoned as such, unbefitting a Noble One (na alamariya) and reckoned as such, black (kaṇhā) and reckoned as such.’

Who is there who has completely abandoned these things—the community of Gotama’s disciples, or some other venerable teachers and their disciples?"

390. "It is possible, Kassapa, that the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say this: ‘Of these things that are unskilled and reckoned as such, censurable and reckoned as such, to be refrained from and reckoned as such, unbefitting a Noble One and reckoned as such, black and reckoned as such,

the community of Gotama’s disciples has completely abandoned these things, but the other venerable teachers and their disciples only in part.’

In this case, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would give us the greatest share of praise.

391. "Furthermore, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say of the teacher or the Saṅgha:

‘Of those things that are skilled and reckoned as such, blameless and reckoned as such, to be practiced and reckoned as such, fitting for a Noble One and reckoned as such, bright and reckoned as such,

Who is there who has completely mastered these things—the community of Gotama’s disciples, or some other venerable teachers and their disciples?’

392. "It is possible, Kassapa, that the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say this: ‘Of these things that are skilled and reckoned as such, blameless and reckoned as such, to be practiced and reckoned as such, fitting for a Noble One and reckoned as such, bright and reckoned as such,

the community of Gotama’s disciples has completely mastered these things, but the other venerable teachers and their disciples only in part.’

In this case, Kassapa, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would give us the greatest share of praise.

The Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo)

393. "There is a path, Kassapa, there is a course of training, whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point—the Dhamma and the discipline.’

What is this path and this course of training? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path:

namely, right view (sammādiṭṭhi), right intention (sammāsaṅkappo), right speech (sammāvācā), right action (sammākammanto), right livelihood (sammāājīvo), right effort (sammāvāyāmo), right mindfulness (sammāsati), right concentration (sammāsamādhi).

This is the path, Kassapa, this is the course of training, whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point—the Dhamma and the discipline.’" Talk about Ascetic Practices
394.
When this was said, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: "These ascetic practices of those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* are considered as asceticism and Brahmanism.
The naked ascetic lives rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not responding to polite requests to come or stay. He does not accept food offered or prepared for him, or an invitation to a meal.
He does not receive anything from a pot or a pan, across a threshold, across a stick, or across a pestle, from two people eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying with a man, from where food is advertised to be distributed, from where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.
He may be a one-house man or a one-morsel man, a two-house man or a two-morsel man… up to a seven-house man or a seven-morsel man. He sustains himself on one offering, two offerings… up to seven offerings. He takes food once a day, once every two days… up to once every seven days.
Thus he lives pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals even up to once every fortnight.
395.
"These ascetic practices of those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* are considered as asceticism and Brahmanism.
He is an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or *daddula* or *haṭa* or rice bran or rice scum or sesame flour or grass or cow dung. He lives on forest roots and fruits, he feeds on fallen fruits.
396.
"These ascetic practices of those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* are considered as asceticism and Brahmanism.
He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust heap, garments of bark fiber, antelope skins, a strip of antelope hide, *kusa*-grass fabric, bark fabric, *phalaka* fabric, blankets of human hair or horsehair, the wings of owls. He is a plucker-out of hair and beard, devoted to this practice.
He is one who stands continuously, rejecting seats; he is one who squats continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position; he is one who uses a mattress of spikes, making a mattress of spikes his bed; he uses a plank bed, or a bare-ground bed. He lives resorting to only one posture, covered with dirt and grime. He lives in the open air, accepting whatever seat is offered. He is one who avoids company, devoted to the practice of avoiding company, one who is addicted to the practice of avoiding drinks, and he dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening."
Commentary on the meaninglessness of ascetic practices
397.
"Even if a naked ascetic, Kassapa, lives rejecting conventions, licking his hands… and pursues the practice of taking food at stated intervals even up to once every fortnight,
but if his morality ( *śīlasampadā*), his heart (*cittasampadā*) and his wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*) are undeveloped and unrealized,
then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) or a *brāhmaṇa*.
But, Kassapa, when a *bhikkhu* develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness, and abandoning the corruptions, realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realized it in this very life by his own insight,
then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* is termed an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) and a *brāhmaṇa*.
"Even if he is a herb-eater, Kassapa, or a millet-eater… and lives on forest roots and fruits, feeding on fallen fruits,
but if his morality ( *śīlasampadā*), his heart (*cittasampadā*) and his wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*) are undeveloped and unrealized,
then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) or a *brāhmaṇa*.
But, Kassapa, when a *bhikkhu* develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness, and abandoning the corruptions, realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realized it in this very life by his own insight,
then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* is termed an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) and a *brāhmaṇa*.
"Even if, Kassapa, he wears coarse hemp or mixed material… and dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening,
but if his morality ( *śīlasampadā*), his heart (*cittasampadā*) and his wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*) are undeveloped and unrealized,
then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) or a By means of a *brahmañña*.
But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity (*averaṃ*), non-ill-will (*abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettacittaṃ*), and, abandoning the corruptions (*āsavānaṃ khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind (*anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom (*paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life (*diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight (*sayaṃ abhiññā*)…
Then, Kassapa, that monk is termed an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*).'
398.
At this Kassapa said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, it is hard to be an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*), it is hard to be a *brahmañña*.’
‘So they say in the world, Kassapa: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*), it is hard to be a *brahmañña*.”
because even if he goes naked (*acelako*), is of loose habits, licks his hand… and applies himself to the practice of partaking of food at fixed intervals of half a month.
and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of being an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*) or *brahmañña*, it would not be right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*), it is hard to be a *brahmañña*”,
because any house­holder or householder’s son — even the slave-girl who draws water — could do this saying: “Well, I will go naked (*acelako*)…
But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*), it is hard to be a *brahmañña*.”
But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity (*averaṃ*), non-ill-will (*abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettacittaṃ*), and, abandoning the corruptions (*āsavānaṃ khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind (*anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom (*paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life (*diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight (*sayaṃ abhiññā*)…
Then, Kassapa, that monk is termed an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*).
He is an eater of greens (*sākabhakkho*) or millet (*sāmākabhakkho*)…He lives on forest roots and fruits (*vanamūlaphalāhāro*), he feeds on fallen fruits (*pavattaphalabhojī*).
and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of being an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*) or *brahmañña*, it would not be right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*sāmaññaṃ*), it is hard to be a *brahmañña*”,
because any house­holder or householder’s son — even the slave-girl who draws water — could do this saying: “Well, I will be an eater of greens (*sākabhakkho*) or millet (*sāmākabhakkho*)… I live on forest roots and fruits (*vanamūlaphalāhāro*), I feed on fallen fruits (*pavattaphalabhojī*)!” But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism or Brahmanism beside this, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic ( *śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin ( *brāhmaṇa*).”

But, Kassapa, when a monk ( *bhikkhu*) develops non-enmity ( *averaṃ*), non-ill-will ( *abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness ( *mettacittaṃ*) and, abandoning the corruptions ( *āsavānaṃ khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind ( *anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom ( *paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life ( *diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight ( *sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā*)
then, Kassapa, that monk ( *bhikkhu*) is termed an ascetic ( *samaṇo*) and a Brahmin ( *brāhmaṇo*).’

"Even if, Kassapa, he wears hempen garments ( *sāṇāni dhāreti*), hempen undergarments ( *masāṇāni dhāreti*)…pe… he dwells addicted to the practice of repeated bathing ( *sāyatatiyakampi udakorohanānuyogamanuyutto viharati*)."

And if this were the measure and practice of asceticism ( *sāmaññaṃ*) or Brahmanism ( *brahmaññaṃ*), the difficulty, the great difficulty, it would not be right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic ( *śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin ( *brāhmaṇa*).”

"And this could have been done by a householder ( *gahapatinā*) or a householder’s son ( *gahapatiputtena*) or even a slave woman ( *kumbhadāsiyā*) – ‘Come, I will wear hempen garments ( *sāṇāni dhāremi*), hempen undergarments ( *masāṇāni dhāremi*)…pe… I will dwell addicted to the practice of repeated bathing (*sāyatatiyakampi udakorohanānuyogamanuyutto viharāmi*)."

But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism (*sāmaññaṃ*) or Brahmanism (*brahmaññaṃ*) beside this, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).”

But, Kassapa, when a monk ( *bhikkhu*) develops non-enmity ( *averaṃ*), non-ill-will ( *abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness ( *mettacittaṃ*) and, abandoning the corruptions ( *āsavānaṃ khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind ( *anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom ( *paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life ( *diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight ( *sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā*).
then that monk (*bhikkhu*) is called an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin(*brāhmaṇo*).’

399.
When this was said, the naked ascetic Kassapa said to the Blessed One ( *bhagavantaṃ*): “It is hard to understand an ascetic ( *samaṇo*), Venerable Gotama, it is hard to understand a Brahmin ( *brāhmaṇo*).”

"So they say in the world (*lokasmiṃ*), Kassapa: “It is hard to understand an ascetic (*samaṇo*), it is hard to understand a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*)."

Even a naked ascetic (*acelako*), Kassapa, might be of loose habits ( *muttācāro*), a hand-licker ( *hatthāpalekhano*)…pe… thus he dwells addicted to the practice of eating alternative meals every fortnight (*addhamāsikampi pariyāyabhattabhojanānuyogamanuyutto viharati*).

And if this were the measure and practice of an ascetic ( *samaṇo*) And even if, Kassapa, he wears hempen garments, and also wears coarse hempen garments…and he practices repeated bathing in water.

And, Kassapa, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were difficult or very difficult to understand by this measure, by this practice of austerity, then it would not be right to say: "A *śramaṇa* is difficult to understand, a *brāhmaṇa* is difficult to understand."

And it would be possible to know of him, either by a householder, or by a son of a householder, or even by a slave woman using a pot, that, "This one wears hempen garments, and also wears coarse hempen garments…and he practices repeated bathing in water."

But because, Kassapa, there is a very different kind of *śramaṇa* or *brāhmaṇa* beside this, who is difficult or very difficult to understand, therefore it is right to say: "A *śramaṇa* is difficult to understand, a *brāhmaṇa* is difficult to understand.”

But, Kassapa, when a *bhikṣu* develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness, and, abandoning the corruptions, realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the de­liverance through wisdom, having realised it in this very life by his own insight,

then, Kassapa, that *bhikṣu* is termed an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).’

The perfection of morality, concentration, and wisdom.

400.

When this was said, the naked ascetic, Kassapa, said this to the Blessed One: "But what, Venerable Gotama, is the perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)? What is the perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*)? What is the perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)?" "Here, Kassapa, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha… (as in sections 190-193, so it should be explained in detail) seeing danger, he undertakes and trains himself in the training rules, endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, with purified livelihood, perfected in morality, guarding the doors of the senses, endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, content.

401.

“And how, Kassapa, is a *bhikṣu* perfected in morality (*śīlasampanno*)? Here, Kassapa, a *bhikṣu*, having abandoned the taking of life, abstains from taking life, with his rod laid down, his weapon laid down, conscientious, full of kindness, he dwells full of compassion for the welfare of all living beings.

This pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)… (as in sections 194 up to 210)

"Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts

they make their living.

That is to say: spells for safety, spells for success…(as in section 211) the *prātimokṣa* of medicinal herbs, either this or that; he abstains from wrong livelihood, by such base arts.

This pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*).

"Great king, the *bhikṣu* who is thus possessed of moral discipline (*śīlasampanno*) sees no danger anywhere in regard to his restraint by moral discipline.

Just as a head-anointed noble warrior who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies.

So too, Kassapa, the *bhikṣu* who is thus possessed of moral discipline (*śīlasampanno*) sees no danger anywhere in regard to his restraint by moral discipline.

Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*śīlakkhandha*), he experiences within himself a blameless happiness (*anavajjasukhaṃ*).

Thus, Kassapa, a *bhikṣu* is perfected in morality (*śīlasampanno*).

That, Kassapa, is the perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)…he attains the first *jhāna*, and dwells in it.

This comes to him through the perfection of the heart/mind (*cittasampadā*)…the second *jhāna*…the third *jhāna*…the fourth *jhāna*, he attains and dwells in it.

This pertains to his perfection of the heart/mind (*cittasampadā*).

That, Kassapa, is the perfection of the heart/mind (*cittasampadā*).

“So, with the heart/mind thus concentrated…he directs and inclines the heart/mind to the knowledge and vision…This pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)…he understands: ‘There is nothing further here’…This pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

That, Kassapa, is the perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

“And, Kassapa, there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality (*śīlasampadāya*), of the heart/mind (*cittasampadāya*) and of wisdom (*prajñāsampadāya*).

The Lion's Roar Discourse

402.

‘Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach morality (*śīlavādā*).

They praise morality (*śīlassa vaṇṇaṃ*) in various ways.

But as regards the highest Ariyan morality (*ariyaṃ paramaṃ sīlaṃ*), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. But rather, I alone am greater in that, namely, higher morality (*adhiśīlaṃ*).

"Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach self-mortification and scrupulous austerity (*tapojigucchāvādā*).

They praise self-mortification and scrupulous austerity (*tapojigucchāya vaṇṇaṃ*) in various ways.

As far as, Kassapa, the noble, supreme Supreme is self-mortification and scrupulous austerity, but as regards that, I do not see anyone equal to me, how could there be anyone greater! But indeed, I alone am greater in that, namely, excessive scrupulousness.

"Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdom (paññāvādā).

They praise wisdom in various ways.

But as regards the highest Āryan wisdom (ariyā paramā paññā), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. But indeed, I alone am greater in that, namely, superior wisdom (adhipaññaṃ).

"Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberation (vimuttivādā).

They praise liberation in various ways.

But as regards the highest Āryan liberation (ariyā paramā vimutti), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. But indeed, I alone am greater in that, namely, superior liberation (adhivimutti).

403.

"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), but only in empty places, not in company.”

They should be told that this is not true: ‘mā heva’.

“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), and he roars it in company (parisāsu),” that, Kassapa, is what they should be told.

"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), and in company, but he does so without confidence (visārado).”

They should be told that this is not true: ‘mā heva’.

“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), in company and confidently (visārado),” that, Kassapa, is what they should be told.

"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), in company and confidently, but they do not question him… they question him, but he does not answer… he answers, but he does not win them over with his answers…but they don’t find it pleasing… but they are satisfied with what they have heard… They are satisfied, but they do not show an appearance of satisfaction…pe… they do show an appearance of satisfaction, but they do not embark on the path of truth…pe… they do embark on the path of truth, but those who have embarked do not find satisfaction.’
They should be told that this is not true.

“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company he roars, and confidently he roars, and they question him, and when questioned by them, he answers, and with his answers he pleases their minds, and they consider it worth listening to, and having heard it they are satisfied, and they show an appearance of satisfaction, and they embark on the path of truth, and those who have embarked find satisfaction.” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.

The topic of probation for those formerly of other sects.

404.
“Once, Kassapa, I was staying at Rājagaha, at Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
There a certain ascetic and celibate named Nigrodha asked me a question about the practice of austerity at Adhijegucche.
When asked that question by him at Adhijegucche, I explained it.
And he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure.”

“Who, venerable sir, having heard the *Dhamma* from the Blessed One, would not be delighted beyond all measure? I too, venerable sir, having heard the *Dhamma* from the Blessed One, am delighted beyond all measure."

Wonderful, venerable sir, wonderful, venerable sir!

Just as, venerable sir, one might set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or point out the way to one who was lost, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see forms—just so, by the Blessed One, in many ways has the *Dhamma* been made clear.

I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the *Dhamma*, and to the *bhikkhu-saṅgha* (community of monks).
May I receive the going forth (*pravrajyā*) in the Blessed One’s presence, may I receive the higher ordination (*upasampadā*)".

405.
“Kassapa, whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the going forth (*pravrajyā*) or the higher ordination (*upasampadā*) in this *Dhamma*-discipline, he lives on probation for four months; at the end of four months, if the monks are satisfied, they give him the going forth (*pravrajyā*) and the higher ordination (*upasampadā*) into the state of a *bhikkhu* (monk).

But in this matter, a distinction of persons is known to me.”

“If, venerable sir, those formerly of other sects desire the going forth (*pravrajyā*) in this *Dhamma*-discipline, desire the higher ordination (*upasampadā*), and live on probation for four months; and at the end of four months, if the monks are satisfied, they give them the going forth (*pravrajyā*) and the higher ordination (*upasampadā*),

I will live on probation for four years, and at the end of four years, if the monks are satisfied, may they give me the going forth (*pravrajyā*) and the higher ordination (*upasampadā*) into the state of a *bhikkhu* (monk)." He speaks thus: ‘The self (*ātman*) and the world are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.’

What is the reason for that? Because I, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavour (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with my mind thus concentrated, I recollect my numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*) .

That is to say, one period of contraction and expansion of the world, two periods of contraction and expansion of the world, three periods of contraction and expansion of the world, four periods of contraction and expansion of the world, five periods of contraction and expansion of the world, ten periods of contraction and expansion of the world.

"There I was of such a name, such a clan, such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I arose there. There too I was of such a name, such a clan, such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here."

In this way I recollect many past lives with their characteristics and particulars.

For this reason I know this: the self (*ātman*) and the world are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.’

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the second reason, which some ascetics and Brahmins, adhering to the eternalist doctrine (*sassatavādā*), declare the self (*ātman*) and the world to be eternal.

33.

“And in the third case, venerable monks (*bhonto bhikkhave*), what is the basis for the ascetics and Brahmins who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*) to proclaim the self (*ātman*) and the world as eternal? Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), a certain ascetic (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated, he recollects his numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*).

That is to say, ten periods of contraction and expansion of the world, twenty periods of contraction and expansion of the world, thirty periods of contraction and expansion of the world, forty periods of contraction and expansion of the world – ‘There I was of such a name, such a clan, such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I arose there. There too I was of such a name, such a clan, such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’

In this way he recollects his numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*) in their modes and their details. 9. The Poṭṭhapāda Discourse
The subject of Poṭṭhapāda the Wanderer

406. Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.

Now at that time Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was staying at the single-pavilion rest house in the Tinduka grove, a place for philosophical debates, together with a large company of wanderers, with about three hundred wanderers.

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed and taken his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.

407. Then the Blessed One considered: “It is still too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don't I go to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer at the single-pavilion rest house in the Tinduka grove, a place for philosophical debates."

Then the Blessed One went to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer at the single-pavilion rest house in the Tinduka grove, a place for philosophical debates.

408. Now at that time Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was sitting with a large company of wanderers, making a great noise and racket, engaged in many kinds of trifling talk, such as:

Talk about kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, street gossip, well gossip, tales of the departed, and speculations about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.

409. Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar. Seeing him, he hushed his own company: “Be quiet, good sirs! Do not make a noise!

The contemplative Gotama is coming.

That venerable one desires quiet and speaks in praise of quiet.

Perhaps, knowing our company to be quiet, he will consider it worthwhile to visit us."

When this was said, those wanderers became silent.

410. Then the Blessed One approached Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer.

Then Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Come, Blessed One!

Welcome, Blessed One!

It is a long time, Blessed One, since you have made an opportunity to come here.

Please sit down, Blessed One; this seat is ready."

The Blessed One sat down on the prepared seat.

And Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer, taking a low seat, sat down at one side.

As he was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer: “With what discussion were you engaged just now? What was the discussion between you that was interrupted?”

The discussion about the cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodhakathā*).

411. When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Let that discussion rest, venerable sir, with which we were engaged just now.

It will not be difficult for the Blessed One to hear of that discussion later.

Some time ago, venerable sir, when various ascetics and brahmins, adherents of other views, were gathered and assembled in the hall of debate, a discussion on the cessation of perception arose: ‘How, indeed, does the cessation of perception occur?’ Some said thus: ‘Without a cause, without a condition, perceptions arise and cease in a person.

At the time when they arise, at that time one is percipient.

At the time when they cease, at that time one is non-percipient.’

In this way, some describe the cessation of perception.

But another one says thus: ‘It is not so!"
pī.
’ ‘Yes, sir, that’s how it will be.’
Perception (*saññā*) is a person’s self (*attā*), sir.
which comes and goes.
When it comes, one is percipient.
When it goes, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodhaṃ*).
“Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is.
for there are contemplatives and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) of great power, great potency (*mahiddhikā mahānubhāvā*).
They draw perception in and out of a person.
When they draw it in, one is percipient. It is at that time.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodha).
“Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is.
for there are gods (*devatā*) of great power, great potency.
They draw perception in and out of a person.
When they draw it in, one is percipient.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodha).
“Then the memory of the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) arose within me: ‘Ah, the Blessed One! Ah, the One Well-Gone—who surely is well-skilled in these matters.’
The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodha).
So what, lord, is the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodha)?”
A discussion about the arising and ceasing of perception with a cause.
412.
“In this regard, Poṭṭhapāda, those contemplatives & brahmans who say that a person’s perception arises & ceases without cause, without reason, are wrong from the very start.
Why is that? Because a person’s perception arises & ceases with a cause, with a reason.
With training, one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.”
413.
"And what is training (sikkhā)?" The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) said: "Here, Poṭṭhapāda, the Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, a fully awakened one...pe... (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).
“This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.… “Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
His earlier perception of sensuality ceases.
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion.
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.
This is training (sikkhā)," said the Blessed One (*bhagavā*). “And further, Poṭṭhapāda, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space (*ākāsānañcāyatana*), thinking, ‘Infinite consciousness,’ the monk enters & remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatana*).
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space (*ākāsānañcāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññā*) ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññā*). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññī*).
And thus it is that with training one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.
This too is a training," the Blessed One said.

“And further, Poṭṭhapāda, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatana*), thinking, ‘There is nothing,’ enters & remains in the dimension of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatana*).
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññā*) ceases.
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññā*). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatana-sukhumasacca-saññī*).
And thus it is that with training one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.
This too is a training," the Blessed One said.

414.
“Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception (*saññagga*).
As he remains at the peak of perception (*saññagga*), the thought occurs to him, ‘Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.'
If I were to think and will, these perceptions (*saññā*) of mine would cease, and other gross perceptions (*saññā*) would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?’
So he neither thinks nor wills.
and as he is neither thinking nor willing, those very perceptions (*saññā*) cease and other, grosser perceptions (*saññā*) do not appear.
He touches cessation (*nirodhaṃ phusati*).
This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the cessation of perception (*anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti*).
“Now what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you ever before heard of such an alert step-by step attainment of the cessation of perception (*anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti*)?”
“No, venerable sir.”
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: ‘When the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception (*saññagga*). As he remains at the peak of perception (*saññagga*), the thought occurs to him, "Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me. If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?”

So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear.

He touches cessation. (nirodhaṃ phusati)

This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception.’ (evaṃ kho, poṭṭhapāda, anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti hotī’'ti)

“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” (evaṃ, poṭṭhapādā"ti)

“But, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.” (ekampi kho ahaṃ, poṭṭhapāda, saññaggaṃ paññapemi, puthūpi saññagge paññapemī"ti)

“But how, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, in whatever way one touches cessation, in that way I describe a peak of perception.

That’s how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.”

“Now, lord, does perception arise first, and knowledge after; or does knowledge arise first, and perception after; or do perception & knowledge arise simultaneously?”

“Poṭṭhapāda, perception arises first, and knowledge after. And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.

One discerns, ‘It’s in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen.’

Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first, and knowledge after, and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.”

The Discourse about Perception and Self

“Now, lord, is perception a person’s self, or is perception one thing and self another?”

“What sort of self do you posit, Poṭṭhapāda?”

“Lord, I posit a gross self, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be gross, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, feeding on physical food.

That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another:

even as there remains this gross self—possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, and feeding on food—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

even as there remains this mind-made self—complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties—one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Then, lord, I posit a formless self made of perception.” (arūpiṃ kho ahaṃ, bhante, attānaṃ paccemi saññāmaya"nti.)

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self would be formless and made of perception. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.

”even as there remains this formless self made of perception, one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.”

“Is it possible for me to know, lord, whether perception is a person’s self or if perception is one thing and self another?”
Poṭṭhapāda, since you have other views (aññadiṭṭhika), other practices (aññakhantika), other inclinations (aññarucikena), other aims (aññatrāyogena), and other teachers (aññatrācariyakena), it is difficult for you to know whether perception (saññā) is a person's self (attā), or whether perception is one thing and the self another. 421. Then, the wanderers, not long after the Blessed One had left, jeered at Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer from all sides with words like stinging darts, saying, "Indeed, whatever the contemplative Gotama says, Master Poṭṭhapāda approves of it, saying, 'So it is, Blessed One! So it is, O Well-Gone!'"

But we do not understand the ascetic Gotama to have taught any categorical *dhamma*, saying, "The world is eternal ( *sassato loko*)" or "The world is not eternal (*asassato loko*)," or "The world is finite (*antavā loko*) " or "The world is infinite (*anantavā loko*)," or "The life-principle (*jīva*) is the same as the body (*sarīra*)" or "The life-principle is one thing, and the body another (*aññaṃ sarīra*)," or "The *Tathāgata* exists after death (*hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*)," or "The *Tathāgata* does not exist after death (*na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*)," or "The *Tathāgata* both exists and does not exist after death," or "The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death."

When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to those wanderers, "I, too, friends, do not understand the ascetic Gotama to have taught any categorical *dhamma*, saying, 'The world is eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'… or 'The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death.' But the ascetic Gotama teaches a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the *dhamma* and consonant with the *dhamma*.

And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the *dhamma* and consonant with the *dhamma* is being explained, why should a wise person such as myself not rejoice in the well-spokenness of the ascetic Gotama's well-spoken words?"

The Story of Citta, Hatthissariputta and Poṭṭhapāda.

422. Then, after two or three days, Citta, Hatthissariputta, and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One. Having arrived, Citta, Hatthissariputta, bowed down to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

But Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having concluded their courteous and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, the other day the wanderers jeered at me on all sides, after you had recently departed, with words that stung like darts: ‘Indeed, whatever the ascetic Gotama says, Master Poṭṭhapāda approves, saying: ‘So it is, Blessed One! The ascetic Gotama speaks, and Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word: “So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-Gone.”

But we don’t understand the ascetic Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or whether the cosmos is finite ( *antavā loko* ) or the cosmos is infinite ( *anantavā loko* ) or whether the soul & the body are the same ( *taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīra* ) or whether the soul is one thing and the body another ( *aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīra* ) or whether after death a *Tathāgata* exists ( *hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or whether after death a *Tathāgata* does not exist ( *na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or whether after death a *Tathāgata* both exists & does not exist ( *hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or whether after death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist ( *neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ).’

When this was said, I replied to the wanderers, ‘I, too, don’t understand the ascetic Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal …whether after death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist. But the ascetic Gotama describes a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma.

And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained, why shouldn’t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well-spokenness of the ascetic Gotama’s well-spoken words?”

423. “Poṭṭhapāda, all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes. You alone among them have eyes.

I have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical, and some teachings to be not categorical.

“And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be not categorical? ‘The cosmos is eternal’ ( *sassato loko* ), I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching. ‘The cosmos is not eternal’ ( *asassato loko* ), I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching. ‘The cosmos is finite’ ( *antavā loko* )…‘The cosmos is infinite’ ( *anantavā loko* )… ‘The soul & the body are the same’ ( *taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīra* )… ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’ ( *aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīra* )… ‘After death a *Tathāgata* exists’ ( *hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* )… ‘After death a *Tathāgata* does not exist’ ( *na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* )… ‘After death a *Tathāgata* both exists & does not exist’ ( *hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* )…

‘After death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist’ ( *neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching.

“And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be not categorical? Because they are not conducive to the goal, are not conducive to the Dhamma, are not basic to the holy life. They don’t lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.

That’s why I have taught and declared them to be not categorical.”

A Categorical teaching.

424. “And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be categorical? ‘This is stress’ ( *idaṃ dukkhaṃ* ) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching.

‘This is the origination of stress’ ( *ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo* ) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching.

‘This is the cessation of stress’ ( *ayaṃ dukkhanirodho* ) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching.

‘This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress’ ( *ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā* ) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching.

“And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical? Because they are conducive to the goal, are conducive to the Dhamma, are basic to the holy life. They lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.

That’s why I have taught and declared them to be categorical.

425. “There are some contemplatives & brahmans with a doctrine & view like this: ‘After death, the self ( *attā* ) is exclusively happy and free from disease.’

I approached them and asked them, ‘Is it true that you have a doctrine & view like this: “After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease”?’ If they answered me in the affirmative,

I would say: ‘But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?’ If so asked, they answer, ‘No.’

“I would say: ‘But have you ever been aware of a self ( *attānaṃ* ) exclusively happy for a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ Are you aware?"’iti puṭṭhā ‘no’ti vadanti.

Then I say this to them: ‘But do you, venerable sirs, know that "this is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world"?’iti puṭṭhā ‘no’ti vadanti.

“Then I say this to them: ‘But have you, venerable sirs, heard the voices of the gods reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, “Practice well, my dears. Practice straightforwardly, my dears, for the realization of an exclusively happy world, because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world”?’iti puṭṭhā ‘no’ti vadanti.

“So what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing?” “Yes, lord. When this is the case, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing.”

426. “Poṭṭhapāda, it’s as if a man were to say, ‘I’m in love with the most beautiful woman in this country,’

and other people were to say to him, ‘Well, my good man, this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love: do you know if she’s of the warrior caste *kṣatriyī*, the Brahman caste *brāhmaṇī*, the merchant caste *vessī*, or the laborer caste *śūddī*?’iti puṭṭho ‘no’ti vadeyya.

Then they would say to him, ‘Well then, do you know her name or clan name? Whether she’s tall *dīghā*, short *rassā*, or of medium height *majjhimā*? Whether she’s dark *kāḷī*, fair *sāmā*, or ruddy-skinned *maṅguracchavī*? Do you know what village *gāme* or town *nigame* or city *nagare* she’s from?’iti puṭṭho ‘no’ti vadeyya.

Then they would say to him, ‘So you’ve never known or seen the woman you’re in love with?’iti puṭṭho ‘āmā’ti vadeyya.

“So what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing?” “Surely, venerable sir, that being so, that man’s talk would amount to nonsense.”

“In the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and Brahmins with a doctrine and view like this: ‘After death, the self *ātmā* is exclusively happy and free from disease *aroga*.’

I approached them and asked them, ‘Is it true that you have a doctrine and view like this: These are of such a view: “After death, the self is exclusively happy, free from disease.” When asked this, they acknowledge, ‘Yes.’
Then I say to them, ‘But do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’
Then I say to them, ‘But do you, venerable sirs, ever cognize a self as exclusively happy for even a night, a day, half a night, or half a day?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’
Then I say to them, ‘But do you, venerable sirs, know that “This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world”?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’
Then I say to them, ‘But have you, venerable sirs, heard the sound of those deities who have arisen in an exclusively happy world speaking thus: "Those practicing well, friends, those practicing uprightly, friends, are those [who attain] the realization of an exclusively happy world. We, too, friends, by practicing thus, have arisen in an exclusively happy world"?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’
“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, doesn’t the speech of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing?” “Surely, venerable sir, when this is the case, the speech of those ascetics and Brahmins turns out to be unconvincing.”
427.
“Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to build a staircase at a crossroads for ascending to a palace.
Someone might say to him, ‘Good man, do you know if that palace for which you are building the staircase is to the east, south, west, or north? Is it high, low, or middling?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘No.’
Someone might say to him, ‘Good man, you do not know or see that palace, and yet you are building a staircase to ascend to it?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘Yes.’
“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, doesn’t the speech of that man turn out to be unconvincing?” “Surely, venerable sir, when this is the case, the speech of that man turns out to be unconvincing.” In the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* who maintain and hold the view that: ‘After death, the self (ātman) is exclusively happy and free from disease.’

I approached them and asked them, ‘Is it true that you, venerable sirs, maintain and hold the view that: "After death, the self (ātman) is exclusively happy and free from disease?"’ If they, being asked by me in this way, acknowledge ‘Yes,’

I then say this: ‘But do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world (loka)?’ Being asked thus, they say, ‘No.’

I then say this: ‘But have you, venerable sirs, ever been aware of a self (ātman) that is exclusively happy for even a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ Being asked thus, they say, ‘No.’

I then say this: ‘But do you, venerable sirs, know that "This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world (loka)?"’ Being asked thus, they say, ‘No.’

I then say this: ‘But have you, venerable sirs, heard the voices of the deities (devatā) reborn in an exclusively happy world (loka), saying, "Practice well, dear sirs. Practice straightforwardly, dear sirs, for the realization of an exclusively happy world (loka), because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world (loka)?"’ Being asked thus, they say, ‘No.’

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* turn out to be unconvincing?” “Yes, lord. When this is the case, the words of those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* turn out to be unconvincing.”

There are three appropriations of a self (ātman).

“Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three appropriations of a self (ātman): the gross appropriation of a self (oḷāriko attapaṭilābho), the mind-made appropriation of a self (manomayo attapaṭilābho), and the formless appropriation of a self (arūpo attapaṭilābho).

And what, Poṭṭhapāda, is the gross appropriation of a self (oḷāriko attapaṭilābho)? It is possessed of form, made of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtiko), and feeds on solid food (kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho). This is the gross appropriation of a self (oḷāriko attapaṭilābho).

And what is the mind-made appropriation of a self (manomayo attapaṭilābho)? It is possessed of form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. This is the mind-made appropriation of a self (manomayo attapaṭilābho).

And what is the formless appropriation of a self (arūpo attapaṭilābho)? It is formless and made of perception (saññāmayo). This is the formless appropriation of a self (arūpo attapaṭilābho). “Furthermore, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dharma for the abandoning of the gross appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dharma*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dharma*) will grow, and you will enter and remain in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for yourself in the here and now.

If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters and remains in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for oneself in the here and now, one’s abiding is stressful/painful, you should not see it in that way.

When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters and remains in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for oneself in the here and now, there is joy (*pāmujjaṃ*), rapture (*pīti*), calm (*passaddhi*), mindfulness (*sati*), alertness (*sampajañña*) and a pleasant/happy abiding (*sukho vihāro*).

“I also, Poṭṭhapāda, teach the Dharma for the abandoning of the mind-made appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter and remain in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for yourself in the here and now.

If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters and remains in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for oneself in the here and now, one’s abiding is stressful/painful, you should not see it in that way.

When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters and remains in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for oneself in the here and now, there is joy, rapture, calm, mindfulness, alertness, and a pleasant/happy abiding.

“Furthermore, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dharma for the abandoning of the formless appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter and remain in the culmination and abundance of discernment, having known and realized it for yourself in the here and now.

And though these beings roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.

Why is that? Because I, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavour (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attain to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with my mind thus concentrated, I recollect my numerous past lives (*pubbenivāsa*) .

that he recalls ten, twenty, thirty, forty periods of contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭāni*). “There my name was so-and-so…”.

In this way I recollected many past lives (*pubbenivāsa*) with their characteristics (*sākāraṃ*) and particulars (*sauddesaṃ*).

For this reason I know this: the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭho*), standing firm like a pillar (*esikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*). And though these beings roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.’

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the third case, owing to which, with reference to which, some ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) proclaim the eternity of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*).

34.

“In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) proclaim the eternity of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*)? Here, monks (*bhikkhave*), some recluse (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*) is a rationalist (*takkī*), an investigator (*vīmaṃsī*). He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: “The self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭho*), standing firm like a pillar (*esikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*). And though these beings roam and wander (*sandhāvanti saṃsaranti*), pass away (*cavanti*) and re-arise (*upapajjanti*), yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself.

This, monks (*bhikkhave*), is the fourth case, owing to which, with reference to which, some ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) proclaim the eternity of the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*).

35.

“It is on these four grounds, monks (*bhikkhave*), that those ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists proclaim the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) to be eternal.

Whatever recluses (*samaṇā*) and brahmins (*brāhmaṇā*) there may be who proclaim the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) to be eternal, all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.

36.

“This, monks (*bhikkhave*), the Tathāgata understands: ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.’ He understands as well what transcends this, yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend.

And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nibbuti*). Having understood as they really are the origin (*samudayañca*) and the passing away (*atthaṅgamañca*) of feelings (*vedanānaṃ*), their satisfaction (*assādañca*), their unsatisfactoriness (*ādīnavañca*), and the escape (*nissaraṇañca*) from them, the Tathāgata, monks (*bhikkhave*), is emancipated through non-clinging (*anupādāvimutto*).

37.

“These are those dhammas, monks (*bhikkhave*), that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the Tathāgata, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak.

The first recitation section .

Partial-eternalism

38.

“There are, monks (*bhikkhave*), some ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists in regard to some things and non-eternalists in regard to other things, and who on four grounds proclaim the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.

And owing to what, with reference to what, are those honourable ascetics and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) who are eternalists in regard to some things and non-eternalists in regard to other things proclaim the self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal on four grounds?

39.

“There comes a time, monks (*bhikkhave*), when after the lapse of a long period this world contracts .

While the world is contracting, beings for the most part are reborn in the Ābhassara Brahma-world.

And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time.

40.

“But sooner or later, monks (*bhikkhave*), after the lapse of a long period, there comes a time when this world begins to expand once again.

In this expanding world an empty palace of Brahma appears.

Then a certain being, due to the exhaustion of his life-span or the exhaustion of his merit, passes away from the Ābhassara plane and re-arises in the empty palace of Brahmā. But it should not, Poṭṭhapāda, be regarded thus. When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, there is joy, rapture, calm, mindfulness, alertness, and a pleasant abiding.

432.

“In the past, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now?’ When asked this, I would answer, ‘This, friend, is that gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.’

433.

“In the past, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now?’ When asked this, I would answer, ‘This, friend, is that mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.’

434.

“In the past, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now?’ When Having been asked thus, we would answer: ‘This, friend, is that formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandonment we teach the Dhamma, so that when you practice accordingly, your defiling qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, your purifying qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and in this very life, having directly known and realized it for yourselves through insight (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), you will attain and abide in the complete fulfillment and abundance of wisdom (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*)’.

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t those words turn out to be convincing (*sappāṭihīrakataṃ bhāsitaṃ sampajjatī*)?”
“Yes, venerable sir, when this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing.”

435.

“Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to construct a staircase at a crossroads to ascend to a palace, but the staircase was at the very bottom of that palace.

People might say to him, ‘Hey, fellow, you're building a staircase to ascend to a palace. Do you know where that palace is located? Is it to the east, south, west, or north? Is it high, low, or in between?’ Then he might say, ‘Hey friends, this is the palace for which I am building the staircase. The staircase is at the very bottom of the palace itself.’

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t that man's words turn out to be convincing (*sappāṭihīrakataṃ bhāsitaṃ sampajjatī*)?”
“Yes, venerable sir, when this is the case, that man's words turn out to be convincing.”

436.

“Just so, Poṭṭhapāda, if others were to ask us: ‘What, friend, is the gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*)? ... What, friend, is the mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*)? ... What, friend, is the formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandonment you teach the Dhamma, so that when you practice accordingly, your defiling qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, your purifying qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and in this very life, having directly known and realized it for yourselves through insight (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), you will attain and abide in the complete fulfillment and abundance of wisdom (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*)?’ Then, being asked thus, we would answer thus: ‘This, friend, is that formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandonment we teach the Dhamma, so that when you practice accordingly, your defiling qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, your purifying qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow,

and in this very life, having directly known and realized it for yourselves through insight (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), you will attain and abide in the complete fulfillment and abundance of wisdom (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*)’.

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t those words turn out to be convincing (*sappāṭihīrakataṃ bhāsitaṃ sampajjatī*)?”
“Yes, venerable sir, when this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing.”

437.

When this was said, Citta the elephant trainer's son said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, at the time when there is a gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), is the mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) then void, and the formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) void, and only the gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) true at that time?
Venerable sir, at the time when there is a mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), is the gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) then void, and the formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) void, and only the mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) true at that time?
Venerable sir, at the time when there is a formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*), is the gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) then void, and the mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) void, and only the formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) true at that time?"

"Citta, at the time when there is a gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), it is not reckoned as 'a mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*)', nor is it reckoned as 'a formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*)'; it is reckoned only as 'a gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*)' at that time.
Citta, at the time when there is a mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), it is not reckoned as 'a gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*)', nor is it reckoned as 'a formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*)'; it is reckoned only as 'a mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*)' at that time.
Citta, at the time when there is a formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*), it is not reckoned as 'a gross appropriation of self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*)', nor is it reckoned as 'a mind-made appropriation of self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*)'; it is reckoned only as 'a formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*)' at that time.

438.

"Citta, if they were to ask you thus: 'Did you exist in the past? Did you not not exist? Will you exist in the future? Will you not not exist? Do you exist 439.
“In the same way, Citta, when there is a gross appropriation of a self, at that time, it is not classified as a mind-made appropriation of a self, nor is it classified as a formless appropriation of a self.
It is classified just as a gross appropriation of a self.

Citta, when there is a mind-made appropriation of a self... When there is a formless appropriation of a self, at that time, it is not classified as a gross appropriation of a self, nor is it classified as a mind-made appropriation of a self. It is classified just as a formless appropriation of a self.

440.
“Just as, Citta, milk comes from a cow, curds from milk, butter from curds, ghee from butter, and the skimmings of ghee from ghee.

When there is milk, it’s not classified as curds, butter, ghee, or skimmings of ghee. It’s classified just as milk.

When there are curds... When there is butter... When there is ghee... When there are the skimmings of ghee, they’re not classified as milk, curds, butter, or ghee. They’re classified just as the skimmings of ghee.

In the same way, Citta, when there is a gross appropriation of a self... When there is a mind-made appropriation of a self... When there is a formless appropriation of a self, at that time, it is not classified as a gross appropriation of a self, nor is it classified as a mind-made appropriation of a self. It is classified just as a formless appropriation of a self.

Citta, these are the world's designations (lokasamaññā), the world's expressions (lokaniruttiyo), the world's ways of speaking (lokavohārā), the world's descriptions (lokapaññattiyo), with which the *Tathāgata* expresses himself but without grasping to them.”

441.
When this was said, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said this to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms.

In the same way has the Dhamma been explained by the Blessed One in many ways.

I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Dhamma and the *Saṅgha* of monks.

May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."

The going forth of Citta Hatthi-sāriputta

442.
Citta, the elephant trainer's son, said this to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms.

In the same way has the Dhamma been explained by the Blessed One in many ways.

I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Dhamma and the *Saṅgha* of monks.

May I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order (*pabbajjaṃ*), and also the higher ordination (*upasampadaṃ*)?"

443.
So Citta Hatthi-sāriputta obtained the going forth (*pabbajjaṃ*) in the Blessed One's presence; he obtained the higher ordination (*upasampadaṃ*).

And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute—he in no long time reached & remained in the supreme goal of the holy life (*brahmacariyapariyosānaṃ*), for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the here & now.

He directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.” (*khīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ, kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti*).

And thus Ven. Elephant-trainer’s Son became another one of the *arahants*.

The Poṭṭhapāda Sutta is finished. 10. The Subha Sutta
The Account of Subha, the Student

444. Thus have I heard: On one occasion, the Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove at Anāthapindika's Park, not long after the Blessed One's *parinibbāna*.

At that time, Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business.

445. Then Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, addressed a certain student: “Come, student, go to where the ascetic Ānanda is, and upon arriving, ask the ascetic Ānanda in my name if he is well, free from illness, nimble, strong, and living comfortably, saying, ‘Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks after your well-being, if you are free from illness, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’

And speak thus: ‘It would be good if the esteemed Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.’”

446. "Yes, sir," the student replied to Subha, the student, son of Todeyya. Then he went to where the Venerable Ānanda was, and upon arriving, exchanged courteous greetings with the Venerable Ānanda.

Having concluded the courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, the student said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks after your well-being, if you are free from illness, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And he says this: ‘It would be good if the esteemed Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.’"

447. When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda replied to the student: “It is not the right time, student.

Today, I have taken some medicine.

Perhaps we might visit tomorrow when the time and occasion are suitable.”

"Yes, sir," the student replied to the Venerable Ānanda. Rising from his seat, he went to where Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, was.

Upon arriving, he said to Subha, the student, son of Todeyya: "I have delivered your message to the esteemed Ānanda, ‘Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks after your well-being, if you are free from illness, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And he says this: "It would be good if the esteemed Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion."’

When this was said, sir, the ascetic Ānanda told me, ‘It is not the right time, student.

Today, I have taken some medicine.

Perhaps we might visit tomorrow when the time and occasion are suitable.’

Even with this much, sir, what is the reason that the esteemed Ānanda made an opportunity for even a future visit?"

448. Then, as that night passed, the Venerable Ānanda, in the early morning, dressed, took his bowl and robe, and accompanied by the bhikkhu Cetaka as his attendant, went to the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya. Upon arriving, he sat down on the prepared seat.

Then Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, went to where the Venerable Ānanda was. Upon arriving, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Venerable Ānanda.

Having concluded the courteous and amiable talk, he sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, said to the Venerable Ānanda: “The esteemed Ānanda has been a long-time attendant of the esteemed Gotama, living and staying nearby.

The esteemed Ānanda would know what qualities the esteemed Gotama praised, and in what he encouraged, guided, and established this populace.

What qualities, esteemed Ānanda, did the esteemed Gotama praise, and in what did he encourage, guide, and establish this populace?"

449. "Subha, the Blessed One praised three aggregates, and in them, he encouraged, guided, and established this populace.

Which three? The aggregate of morality (*śīla*) of the noble one (*ārya*), the aggregate of concentration (*samādhi*) of the noble one (*ārya*), and the aggregate of wisdom (*prajñā*) of the noble one (*ārya*).

These, Subha, are the three aggregates that the Blessed One praised, and in them, he encouraged, guided, and established this populace." The Virtue Category.
450.
"Well, Reverend Ānanda, what is the noble Virtue Category that the Reverend Gotama praised, and where did he encourage, settle, and establish this populace?"
"Here, young sir, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one (*arahaṃ*), a fully enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a well-farer (*sugato*), a knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), an unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), a teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), an awakened one (*buddho*), a blessed one (*bhagavā*).

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its people (*pajaṃ*), with its gods and humans (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dhamma* (*dhammaṃ*) that is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with its meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with its phrasing (*sabyañjanaṃ*), and reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*) and pure (*parisuddhaṃ*).

A householder (*gahapati*) or a householder’s son (*gahapatiputto*) or one born in some other clan (*kule paccājāto*) hears that *Dhamma* (*dhammaṃ*).

Having heard that *Dhamma* (*dhammaṃ*), he gains faith (*saddhaṃ*) in the *Tathāgata*.

Endowed with that gain of faith (*saddhāpaṭilābhena*), he reflects thus: ‘Household life is crowded, a dusty path; the homeless life is open. It is not easy, while living in a house, to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure spiritual life, like a polished shell.

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), put on the saffron robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya*)?’

Then, at a later time, having abandoned a small or a large accumulation of wealth (*bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya*), having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives (*ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya*), he shaves off his hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), puts on the saffron robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and goes forth from the home life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati*).

Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the monastic rules (*pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvuto*), possessed of proper behavior and resort (*ācāragocarasampanno*), seeing danger in the slightest faults (*anumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī*), having undertaken to train himself in the training rules (*sikkhāpadesu*), endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action (*kāyakammavacīkammena samannāgato kusalena*), his livelihood is purified (*parisuddhājīvo*), he is accomplished in virtue (*sīlasampanno*), with the doors of his senses guarded (*indriyesu guttadvāro*), endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena samannāgato*), and is content (*santuṭṭho*).

451.
"And how, young sir, is a monk accomplished in virtue (*sīlasampanno*)? Here, young sir, a monk, having abandoned the killing of living beings (*pāṇātipātaṃ pahāya*), abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti*); with rod and weapon laid aside (*nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*), scrupulous (*lajjī*), kindly (*dayāpanno*), he dwells compassionate to all living beings (*sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī viharati*).

Also, young sir, a monk, having abandoned the killing of living beings (*pāṇātipātaṃ pahāya*), abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti*); with rod and weapon laid aside (*nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*), scrupulous (*lajjī*), kindly (*dayāpanno*), He dwells, full of compassion for the welfare of all living beings; this, too, pertains to his morality.

(As explained extensively in sections 194 to 210).

“Or, some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: performing appeasement rituals ( *santikamma*), performing vows (*paṇidhikamma*), demonology (*bhūtakamma*), inducing virility (*bhūrikamma*), spells to secure success (*vassakamma*), spells to undo previous spells (*vossakamma*), preparing sites for houses (*vatthukamma*), consecrating sites (*vatthuparikamma*), giving ceremonial mouthwashes (*ācamana*), giving ceremonial bathing (*nhāpana*), offering sacrificial fires (*juhana*), administering emetics (*vamana*), administering purgatives (*virecana*), administering expectorants (*uddhaṃvirecana*), administering phlegmagogues (*adhovirecana*), administering head-purge (*sīsavirecana*), giving ear-oil (*kaṇṇatelaṃ*), giving eye-salves (*nettatappanaṃ*), administering nasal treatments (*natthukammaṃ*), applying collyrium (*añjanaṃ*), applying counter-collyrium (*paccañjanaṃ*), performing eye-surgery (*sālākiyaṃ*), performing surgery (*sallakattiyaṃ*), practicing pediatrics (*dārakatikicchā*), providing roots as medicine (*mūlabhesajjānaṃ anuppadānaṃ*), and dispensing herbal remedies (*osadhīnaṃ paṭimokkho*). A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

And furthermore, young man, a monk refrains from such debased practices whereby some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by wrong means of livelihood, such as performing appeasement rituals (*santikamma*), performing vows (*paṇidhikamma*)… and dispensing herbal remedies (*osadhīnaṃ paṭimokkho*). A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

This, too, pertains to his morality.

452.

"Young man, the monk who is thus perfected in morality sees no fear from any side, owing to his being restrained by morality (*sīlasaṃvarato*).

Just as, young man, a Khattiya king, anointed as king, having defeated his enemies, sees no fear from any side, owing to his having vanquished his adversaries (*paccatthikato*).

In the same way, young man, the monk who is thus perfected in morality sees no fear from any side, owing to his being restrained by morality (*sīlasaṃvarato*).

Possessing this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*arīyena sīlakkhandhena*), he experiences within himself a blameless happiness (*anavajjasukhaṃ*).

In this way, young man, a monk is perfected in morality (*sīlasampanno*).

453.

"Young man, this is that noble aggregate of moral discipline (*ariyo sīlakkhandho*) which the Blessed One praised, and with which he inspired, established, and settled this populace.

Something more remains to be done here."

"It is wonderful, Ānanda, it is marvelous, Ānanda! This noble aggregate of moral discipline (*ariyo sīlakkhandho*) is perfectly complete, not incomplete.

And I do not see this aggregate of moral discipline (*ariyaṃ sīlakkhandhaṃ*) thus perfectly complete anywhere outside of this, among other ascetics and Brahmins. I do not perceive.
And if, Reverend Ānanda, other ascetics and Brahmins were to perceive this complete noble category of virtue in themselves, they would be pleased with just that much, thinking: ‘Enough has been done! The goal of asceticism has been reached! There is nothing more to be done!’
And yet the esteemed Ānanda says thus: ‘But there is still more to be done!’ [Immediately after this, sī.
pī.
The reading "paṭhamabhāṇavāraṃ" is seen in the books].
The concentration category.
454.
"What, Ānanda, is that noble concentration category, the virtues of which the esteemed Gotama expounded, and in which he encouraged, trained, and established these people?"
"And how, young man, does a monk guard the senses? Here, young man, on seeing a form with the eye, a monk does not grasp at its signs and features. Because if he dwells with the eye faculty unrestrained, evil and unwholesome states of longing and sadness might invade him, he practices its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty.
Having heard a sound with the ear...pe... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp its signs and features. Since, if he dwells with the mind faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty.
Endowed with this noble restraint of the sense faculties ( *indriyasaṃvara* ), he experiences within himself unblemished happiness.
In this way, young man, a monk is a guardian of the senses.
455.
"And how, young man, is a monk endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension ( *satisampajañña* )? Here, young man, a monk is fully aware when going forward and returning; fully aware when looking ahead and looking away; fully aware when flexing and extending his limbs; fully aware when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; fully aware when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; fully aware when defecating or urinating; fully aware when walking, standing, In sitting, in sleeping, in waking, in talking, and in maintaining silence, he acts with full awareness.
In this way, young man, the *bhikkhu* is accomplished in mindfulness and clear comprehension.
456.
"And how, young man, is a *bhikkhu* content? Here, young man, a *bhikkhu* is content with robes to protect his body (*kāyaparihārikena cīvarena*) and with almsfood (*piṇḍapāta*) to sustain his belly (*kucchiparihārikena*).
Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only along with him.
Just as a bird, young man, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, young man, the *bhikkhu* becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach.
Wherever he goes, he sets out taking only along with him.
In this way, young man, the *bhikkhu* is content.
457.
“Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*arīyena sīlakkhandhena*), this noble restraint over the sense faculties (*indriyasaṃvarena*), this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena*), and this noble contentment (*santuṭṭhiyā*), he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest (*araññaṃ*), the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūlaṃ*), a mountain (*pabbataṃ*), a glen (*kandaraṃ*), a hillside cave (*giriguhaṃ*), a cremation ground (*susānaṃ*), a jungle grove (*vanapatthaṃ*), the open air (*abbhokāsaṃ*), a heap of straw (*palālapuñjaṃ*).
Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round (*piṇḍapāta*), he sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him.
458.
"Abandoning covetousness (*abhijjhaṃ*) for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness (*abhijjhaṃ*).
Abandoning ill will and hatred (*byāpādapadosaṃ*), he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings (*sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī*); he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred.
Abandoning sloth and torpor (*thinamiddhaṃ*), he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of light (*ālokasaññī*), mindful and fully aware (*sato sampajāno*); he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor.
Abandoning restlessness and remorse (*uddhaccakukkuccaṃ*), he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful (*ajjhattaṃ vūpasantacitto*); he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse.
Abandoning doubt (*vicikicchaṃ*), he abides having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states (*kusalesu dhammesu*); he purifies his mind from doubt.
459.
"Just as, young man, a man were to take a loan (*iṇaṃ ādāya*) and apply it to his business (*kammante payojeyya*).
And his business were to succeed.
So that he might pay off his old debts (*iṇamūlāni*), and with what was left over could support a wife (*dārabharaṇāya*).
He might think: “Before this I developed my business by borrowing.
And my business succeeded.
And I have paid off my old debts, and there is something left over for supporting a wife.”
And as a result he would become glad and experience joy.
460.
"Or suppose, young man, a man were afflicted, suffering and gravely ill (*ābādhiko dukkhito bāḷhagilāno*), and his food would not agree with him and his body had no strength.
But later he would recover from the affliction (*ābādhā*), and his food would agree with him and his body would regain strength.
He might think: “Before this I was ill, suffering and gravely ill, and my food did not agree with me and my body had no strength.
But now I have recovered from that illness, and my food agrees with me, and my body has regained strength.”
And as a result he would become glad and experience joy.
461.
"Or suppose, young man, a man were locked up in a prison (*bandhanāgāre baddho*).
After some time he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss of his possessions (*bhogānaṃ vayo*).
He might think: “Before this I was in prison.
But now I have been released from that prison, safe and secure, and I have suffered no loss of possessions.”
And as a result he would become glad and experience joy.
462.
"Or suppose, young man, a man were a slave (*dāso*), without independence (*anattādhīno*), subservient to others (*parādhīno*), unable to go where he wants (*na yenakāmaṃgamo*).
After some time, he would be released from that slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a free man able to go where he wants.

He might think: "Before this, I was a slave, not self-dependent, dependent on others, not able to go where I wanted.

Now at this time, I am freed from that slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a free man able to go where I want."

As a result of that, he would gain joy (*prāmojjaṃ*) and experience gladness (*saumanassaṃ*).

463.

"Just as, young man, a person with wealth and possessions might travel a desert road, where food is scarce and dangers abound.

After some time, he would cross that desert, and arrive safely at a village, secure and free from danger. Thus he might think: 'Before this, I, with wealth and possessions, undertook a dangerous and frightening journey through the wilderness.

Now I have safely crossed the wilderness, reached the edge of the village in safety, and am free from fear.'

Then, as a result, he would gain joy (*pāmojjaṃ*) and attain gladness (*somanassaṃ*).

464.

"Just so, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu* sees these five hindrances (*pañca nīvaraṇe*) as unabandoned within himself, like a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, or a dangerous wilderness road (*kantāraddhānamaggaṃ*).

465.

"Just as, Māṇava, it is like freedom from debt (*āṇaṇyaṃ*), like good health (*ārogyaṃ*), like release from prison (*bandhanāmokkhaṃ*), like freedom from slavery (*bhujissaṃ*), like a safe land (*khemantabhūmiṃ*).

Just so, a *bhikkhu* sees these five hindrances (*pañca nīvaraṇe*) as abandoned within himself.

466.

"When he sees these five hindrances (*pañca nīvaraṇe*) as abandoned within himself, gladness (*pāmojjaṃ*) arises. When he is gladdened, rapture (*pīti*) arises. When his mind is filled with rapture (*pītimanassa*), his body becomes tranquil (*passambhati*); with a tranquil body (*passaddhakāyo*), he experiences happiness (*sukhaṃ vedeti*); being happy (*sukhino*), his mind becomes concentrated (*samādhiyati*).

467.

"Quite secluded from sense pleasures (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome states (*akusalehi dhammehi*), with applied and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*), he enters and remains in the first *jhāna*, which is with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati*).

He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena apphuṭaṃ hoti*).

"Just as, Māṇava, a skilled bath man or a bath man’s apprentice pours bath powder into a metal basin, sprinkles it with water, and kneads it bit by bit.

The ball of bath powder becomes permeated and saturated inside and out with moisture, yet does not drip.

Just so, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu* drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena apphuṭaṃ hoti*).

And further, Māṇava, the *bhikkhu*, quite secluded from sense pleasures (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome states (*akusalehi dhammehi*), with applied and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*), enters and remains in the first *jhāna*, which is with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati*).

He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire ...so that there is no part of his body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.
This comes to him through concentration.
468.
"Again, māṇava, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a *bhikṣu* enters upon and abides in the second *jhāna*, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
And with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched.
"Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below.
It would have no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be refilled from time to time with showers of rain;
then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water.
So too, māṇava, a *bhikṣu*…pe… with the subsiding of thinking and pondering… pe… enters and remains in the second *jhāna*, so he makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
This comes to him through concentration.
469.
"Again, māṇava, with the fading away as well of rapture, a *bhikṣu* abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third *jhāna*, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’
And with this joy devoid of delight he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched.
"Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool water; There he dwells, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And he continues thus for a long, long period of time.

41.

“Then, as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time, there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation: ‘Oh, that other beings might come to this place!’

And other beings, from exhaustion of their life-span or of their merits, fall from the Ābhassara world and arise in the Brahma-palace as companions for this being.

There they dwell, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And they continue thus for a long, long period of time.

42.

“Thereupon the being who re-arose there first thinks to himself: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be.

These beings were created by me.

Why is that? Because first I made the wish: “Oh, that other beings might come to this place!”

That was my wish, and then these beings came into this existence!’

“And the beings who re-arose there after him also think: ‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be.

We were created by him.

Why is that? We have seen that he was here first, and that we arose after him.’”

43.

“Herein, *bhikkhus*, the being who re-arose there first possesses longer life, greater beauty, and greater authority than the beings who re-arose there after him.

But those beings who arose subsequently possess shorter life, less beauty, and less authority.

44.

“And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth from the household life,

he, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life (*pubbenivāsa*), but none previous to that.

“He speaks thus: ‘We were created by him, by Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and he will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we who were created by that Brahmā, we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, fated to fall away, and we have come to this world.’”

This, *bhikkhus*, is the first instance, owing to which, with reference to which, some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim their views that are partly eternalist and partly non-eternalist, proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.

45.

“In the second case, owing to what, with reference to what, do some honourable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views that are partly eternalist and partly non-eternalist, proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal? There are, *bhikkhus*, certain devas called the Playful, who spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play.

As a consequence of spending an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play, their mindfulness is dissipated.

Through the dissipation of mindfulness, those devas pass away from that state.

46.

“And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth from the household life, he, by means of ardour (*ātappa*), endeavor (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāra*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*ceto-samādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life (*pubbenivāsa*), but none previous to that.

“He speaks thus: ‘Those reverend *devas* who are not corrupted by pleasure do not spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.

As a consequence their mindfulness is not dissipated. either unpervaded by the cool water.
Even so, young man, a *bhikkhu*… with the fading away as well of rapture… a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the third *jhāna*.
He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this body with happiness free from delight, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness free from delight.
This comes to him through concentration (*samādhi*).
470.
“Again, young man, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the fourth *jhāna*, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity (*upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ*).
He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by the pure bright mind.
"Just as if, young man, a man were sitting covered from head to foot in a white garment, so that there would be no part of his entire body not suffused by the white cloth.
Even so, young man, a *bhikkhu*… with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the fourth *jhāna*, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity (*upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ*).
He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by the pure bright mind.
This comes to him through concentration (*samādhi*).
471.
"This, young man, is the noble division of concentration (*ariyo samādhikkhandho*) of which the Blessed One was a proponent, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established this populace.
But something more remains to be done.”
“It is wonderful, venerable Ānanda, it is marvelous, venerable Ānanda! This noble division of concentration (*ariyo samādhikkhandho*) is perfectly complete, not incomplete.
And I do not see this noble division of concentration (*ariyaṃ samādhikkhandhaṃ*) thus perfectly complete anywhere outside of this among other ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas*.
And if any other ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* were to perceive this noble division of concentration (*ariyaṃ samādhikkhandhaṃ*) as thus perfectly complete in themselves, they would be delighted with just that much, [thinking,] 'Enough has been done by us, the goal has been reached by us, there is nothing more for us to do.'
But yet venerable Ānanda says thus: 'But something more remains to be done.'" *Paññākkhandho* - The aggregate of wisdom.
472.
"Reverend Ānanda, what is the division of Ariyan wisdom (*ariyo paññākkhandho*) which the Reverend Gotama praised? Where did he encourage, establish, and settle these people?"
"And so, with mind concentrated (*samāhite citte*), purified (*parisuddhe*) and cleansed (*pariyodāte*), unblemished (*anaṅgaṇe*), free from impurities (*vigatūpakkilese*), malleable (*mudubhūte*), workable (*kammaniye*), established (*ṭhite*), and having gained imperturbability (*āneñjappatte*), he directs and inclines his mind towards knowledge and vision (*ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).
And he understands thus: ‘This my body (*kāyo*) is material (*rūpī*), made up of the four great elements (*cātumahābhūtiko*), born of mother and father (*mātāpettikasambhavo*), fed on rice and gruel (*odanakummāsūpacayo*), impermanent (*anicca*), liable to be injured and abraded (*ucchādanaparimaddana*), broken and destroyed (*bhedanaviddhaṃsanadhammo*), and this is my consciousness (*viññāṇaṃ*) which is bound to it and dependent on it.’
"Suppose, young man (*māṇava*), there were a beautiful beryl gem (*maṇi veḷuriyo*) of purest water, eight-faceted (*aṭṭhaṃso*), well cut (*suparikammakato*), clear (*accho*), bright (*vippasanno*), unflawed (*anāvilo*), perfect in every respect (*sabbākārasampanno*).
And through it there would run a blue (*nīlaṃ*), yellow (*pītaṃ*), red (*lohitaṃ*), white (*odātaṃ*), or brown thread (*paṇḍusuttaṃ*).
Then a man with good sight (*cakkhumā puriso*), taking it in his hand (*hatthe karitvā*), might review it thus: “This is a beautiful beryl gem (*maṇi veḷuriyo*) of purest water, eight-faceted (*aṭṭhaṃso*), well cut (*suparikammakato*), clear (*accho*), bright (*vippasanno*), unflawed (*anāvilo*), perfect in every respect (*sabbākārasampanno*).
And through it there would run a blue (*nīlaṃ*), yellow (*pītaṃ*), red (*lohitaṃ*), white (*odātaṃ*), or brown thread (*paṇḍusuttaṃ*).”
In the same way, young man (*māṇava*), when a *bhikkhu*'s mind is thus concentrated (*samāhite citte*), pure (*parisuddhe*) and bright (*pariyodāte*), unblemished (*anaṅgaṇe*), free from defects (*vigatūpakkilese*), malleable (*mudubhūte*), wieldy (*kammaniye*), steady (*ṭhite*) and attained to imperturbability (*āneñjappatte*), he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision (*ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

And furthermore, young man (*māṇava*), when a *bhikkhu*'s mind is thus concentrated (*samāhite citte*)… and has gained imperturbability (*āneñjappatte*), he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision (*ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).
He understands thus... and is bound up with it.
This comes to him through wisdom (*paññāya*).
473.
“When his mind is thus concentrated (*samāhite citte*), pure (*parisuddhe*) and bright (*pariyodāte*), unblemished (*anaṅgaṇe*), free from defects (*vigatūpakkilese*), malleable (*mudubhūte*), wieldy (*kammaniye*), steady (*ṭhite*), and attained to imperturbability (*āneñjappatte*), he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body (*manomayaṃ kāyaṃ abhinimmānāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).
From this body (*kāyā*) he creates another body (*kāyaṃ*) having material form (*rūpiṃ*), mind-made (*manomayaṃ*), complete in all its parts (*sabbaṅgapaccaṅgiṃ*), not lacking any faculties (*ahīnindriyaṃ*). It is just as if, young man, a person were to draw out a reed from its sheath.

He would think, ‘This is the reed, this is the sheath; the reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’

Or as if, young man, a person were to draw a sword from its scabbard.

He would think, ‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard; the sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’

Or as if, young man, a person were to pull a snake out from its slough.

He would think, ‘This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake is one thing, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has been pulled out.’

In the same way, young man, a *bhikkhu* …pe… when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from impurities, malleable, workable, established, and having gained imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind towards creating a mind-made body (*manomayaṃ kāyaṃ*)…pe….

This comes to him through wisdom (*paññāya*).

474.

And he, with mind concentrated, purified and cleansed, unblemished, free from impurities, malleable, workable, established, and having gained imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind towards the modes of supernormal power (*iddhividhāya*).

He enjoys various supernormal powers (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ paccanubhoti*).

Having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one.

He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space.

He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water.

He walks on the water without sinking as if it were land.

Sitting cross-legged, he travels through space like a winged bird.

He even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are.

He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahmā-world (*brahmalokāpi kāyena vasaṃ vatteti*).

Just as, young man, a skilled potter or his apprentice might make and fashion out of well-prepared clay whatever kind of vessel he might desire.

Or just as, young man, a skilled ivory-worker or his apprentice might make and fashion out of well-prepared ivory whatever kind of ivory work he might desire.

Or just as, young man, a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice might make and fashion out of well-prepared gold whatever kind of gold work he might desire.

In the same way, young man, Bhikkhu... and so on... furthermore, Māṇava, when a *bhikkhu*'s mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, without blemish, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, established, and unshakeable, he directs and applies his mind to the modes of supernormal power.

He experiences the various kinds of supernormal power.

Having been one, he becomes many...and so on...he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.

That comes to him through wisdom.

475.

"When his mind is thus concentrated...and so on...attained to imperturbability, he directs and applies it to the divine element of the ear (*dibba sotadhātu*).

With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, divine and human, those which are far and near.

Just as, Māṇava, a man is traveling along a road.

He might hear the sound of a kettle drum, a small drum, a conch, cymbals, or a kettle-drum.

He would think: ‘This is the sound of a kettle drum, this is the sound of a small drum, this is the sound of a conch, cymbals, or a kettle-drum.’

Just so, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu*…and so on….

Furthermore, Māṇava, when a *bhikkhu*'s mind is thus concentrated…and so on…attained to imperturbability, he directs and applies it to the divine element of the ear (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*).

With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, divine and human, those which are far and near.

That comes to him through wisdom.

476.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified and cleansed, without blemish, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, established, and having attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the knowledge of penetrating the minds of others (*cetopariyañāṇa*).

He understands the minds of other beings and other persons, having encompassed them with his own mind; he understands a mind with lust as ‘a mind with lust,’ a mind without lust as ‘a mind without lust,’ a mind with hate as ‘a mind with hate,’ a mind without hate as ‘a mind without hate,’ a mind with delusion as ‘a mind with delusion,’ a mind without delusion as ‘a mind without delusion,’ a contracted mind as ‘a contracted mind,’ a distracted mind as ‘a distracted mind,’ an exalted mind as ‘an exalted mind,’ an unexalted mind as ‘an unexalted mind,’ a surpassable mind as ‘a surpassable mind,’ an unsurpassable mind as ‘an unsurpassable mind,’ a concentrated mind as ‘a concentrated mind,’ an unconcentrated mind as ‘an unconcentrated mind.' He understands a liberated mind as a liberated mind, and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind.

“Just as, young man, a woman or a man, young, youthful, fond of ornaments, examining their own facial reflection in a clear bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know, if there were a blemish, ‘It has a blemish,’ and if there were no blemish, ‘It has no blemish.’

In the same way, young man, a *bhikṣu*… and when, young man, a *bhikṣu* with mind thus concentrated... directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others.

He discerns the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust… and an unliberated mind as an unliberated mind.

This comes to him through wisdom.

477.

“When his mind is thus concentrated… he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of recollecting past lives.

He recollects his numerous past lives.

That is, one birth, two births, three, four, or five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty births; a hundred births, a thousand births, or a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion: ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life.

Passing away from that, I arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’

Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.

“Just as, young man, a man might go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village, and then from that village he would return to his own village.

He might think: ‘I went from my own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way.

And from that village I went to that other village, and there too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way.

And from that village I have just returned to my own village.’

In the same way, young man, a *bhikṣu*… and when, young man, a *bhikṣu*… Thus, with mind concentrated…and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of recollecting past lives.

He recollects his manifold past lives.

That is, one birth…Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.

That is known to him by wisdom.

478.

“When his mind is thus concentrated…and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.

With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their *kamma*, thus: ‘These beings— who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—

with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower realms, in hell.

But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, who held right view and acted accordingly,

at the breaking up of the body after death, have been reborn in a good destination, a heaven world.’

Thus with the divine eye, purified and surpassing that of humans, he sees beings passing away and re-arising.

“Just as, young man, if there were a pavilion in the middle of a crossroads, and a man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house, walking along the street, or sitting in the middle of the crossroads.

He would think to himself: ‘Those people are entering the house, those are leaving it, those are walking along the streets, and those are sitting in the central square.’

In the same way, young man, the monk…and attained to imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.

With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions.

That is known to him by wisdom.

479.

“When his mind is thus concentrated, purified and bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, He directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions ( *āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

He understands as it actually is: "This is suffering" ( *idaṃ dukkhaṃ*), he understands as it actually is: "This is the origin of suffering" ( *dukkhasamudayo*), he understands as it actually is: "This is the cessation of suffering" ( *dukkha nirodho*), he understands as it actually is: "This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering" ( *dukkha nirodha gāminī paṭipadā*), he understands as it actually is: "These are the cankers" ( *ime āsavā*), He understands as it actually is: "This is the origin of the cankers" ( *āsavasamudayo*), He understands as it actually is: "This is the cessation of the cankers" ( *āsavanirodho*), He understands as it actually is: "This is the path leading to the cessation of the cankers" ( *āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*).

When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire ( *kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*), from the canker of existence ( *bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*), and from the canker of ignorance ( *avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*). When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It’s liberated.’

He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth ( *khīṇā jāti*), the holy life has been lived ( *vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ*), what had to be done has been done ( *kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ*), there is no more for this state of being ( *nāparaṃ itthattāya*).’

"Just as if, Māṇava, in the midst of the mountains there were a pond, clear ( *accho*), limpid ( *vippasanno*), and undisturbed ( *anāvilo*).

A man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see oyster-shells (*sippikasambukaṃpi*), gravel and pebbles (*sakkharakathalaṃpi*), and shoals of fish (*macchagumbaṃpi*) moving about (*carantampi*) and keeping still (*tiṭṭhantampi*).

He might think: “This pond ( *udakarahado* ) is clear (*accho*), limpid (*vippasanno*), and undisturbed (*anāvilo*).

There are oyster-shells (*sippikasambukāpi*), gravel and pebbles (*sakkharakathalāpi*), and shoals of fish (*macchagumbāpi*) moving about (*carantipi*) and keeping still (*tiṭṭhantipī’ti*).”

In the same way, Māṇava, a monk…and so on… just as that monk, Māṇava, with mind thus concentrated ( *evaṃ samāhite citte* )… and so on… having attained imperturbability ( *āneñjappatte*), directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions (*āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

He understands as it actually is: "This is suffering" ( *idaṃ dukkhaṃ* )… and so on… "This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints" ( *āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*).

When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire ( *kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*), from the canker of existence ( *bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*), and from the canker of ignorance ( *avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati*). When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth ( *khīṇā jāti*), the holy life has been lived ( *vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ*), what had to be done has been done ( *kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ*), there is no more for this state of being ( *nāparaṃ itthattāya*).’

This comes to him through wisdom ( *paññāya*).

480.

"That, Māṇava, is the noble aggregate of wisdom ( *ariyo paññākkhandho* ) of which the Blessed One was an advocate, with which he aroused, exhorted and established this populace.

Beyond that there is nothing to be done ( *natthi cevettha uttarikaraṇīya*)."

"Wonderful, Ānanda, amazing, Ānanda! This noble aggregate of wisdom ( *ariyo paññākkhandho* ) is perfectly complete ( *paripuṇṇo*), not incomplete ( *no aparipuṇṇo*).

Thus perfectly complete, I, Ānanda, do not see this noble aggregate of wisdom ( *ariyaṃ paññākkhandhaṃ* ) anywhere else among ascetics and Brahmins. 11. The Kevatta Sutta
The story of Kevatta, the householder's son
481. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Nāḷandā in Pāvārika's mango grove.

Then Kevatta, the householder’s son, approached the Blessed One, prostrated himself before him, and sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, Kevatta, the householder’s son, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, Nāḷandā is thriving, prosperous, populous, crowded with people, and its people have faith in the Blessed One.

Venerable Sir, it would be good if the Blessed One were to instruct a monk to perform a superhuman feat, a miracle of psychic power, so that Nāḷandā would have even greater faith in the Blessed One."

When this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta, the householder’s son: "Kevaṭṭa, I do not teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, perform superhuman feats, miracles of psychic power, for the white-clothed laypeople!'"

482. For a second time, Kevatta, the householder’s son, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, I am not importuning the Blessed One, but I say: 'Venerable Sir, Nāḷandā is thriving, prosperous, populous, crowded with people, and its people have faith in the Blessed One.

Venerable Sir, it would be good if the Blessed One were to instruct a monk to perform a superhuman feat, a miracle of psychic power, so that Nāḷandā would have even greater faith in the Blessed One.'"

For a second time, the Blessed One said to Kevatta, the householder’s son: "Kevaṭṭa, I do not teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, perform superhuman feats, miracles of psychic power, for the white-clothed laypeople!'"

For a third time, Kevatta, the householder’s son, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable Sir, I am not importuning the Blessed One, but I say: 'Venerable Sir, Nāḷandā is thriving, prosperous, populous, crowded with people, and its people have faith in the Blessed One.

Venerable Sir, it would be good if the Blessed One were to instruct a monk to perform a superhuman feat, a miracle of psychic power,

so that Nāḷandā would have even greater faith in the Blessed One.'" 483.
The Lord said: ‘Kevaṭṭa, there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared, having realised them by my own insight.
Which three? The miracle of psychic power (*iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ*), the miracle of telepathy (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ*), the miracle of instruction (*anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ*).
484.
‘And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of psychic power (*iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ*)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk experiences various kinds of psychic power (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ*).
Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
‘Suppose a faithful believer sees that monk wielding various kinds of psychic power (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ*)—being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un- believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic…”
“I saw a monk wielding various kinds of psychic power (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ*)—being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one…he wields mastery with the body as far as the brahma world.”
‘And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the *gandhārī* charm.
It is by means of this that that monk experiences various kinds of psychic power (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ*)—being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one…he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.” “What do you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”
“And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of the miracle of mind-reading ( *iddhipāṭihāriya*), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading.”
Mind-reading miracle (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ*).
485.
“And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of mind-reading (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ*)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk reads the minds of other beings ( *parasattānaṃ*), of other people ( *parapuggalānaṃ*), reads their mental states ( *cittaṃ*), their thoughts ( *cetasikaṃ*), their ponderings ( *vitakkitaṃ*), and their deliberations ( *vicāritaṃ*), and says: ‘That is how your mind (*mano*) is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
“Then a believer sees that monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts, their ponderings, and their deliberations, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
Then that believer tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un-believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power (*mahiddhikatā*) and skill (*mahānubhāvatā*) of that ascetic.
I saw a monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts, their ponderings, and their deliberations, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
“And that sceptic might say to that believer: ‘Sir, there is something called the Manika charm ( *maṇikā nāma vijjā*). It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds ( *cittaṃ* ) of others beings ( *parasattānaṃ*), of other people ( *parapuggalānaṃ*), reads their mental states ( *cetasikaṃ*), their thoughts ( *vitakkitaṃ*), and their deliberations ( *vicāritaṃ*), and says: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.’”
“What do you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”
“And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of the miracle of mind-reading (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ*), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading (*ādesanāpāṭihāriyena*).”
The miracle of instruction (*anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ*).
486.
“And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of instruction (*anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ*)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk gives instruction as follows: ‘Consider in this way ( *evaṃ vitakketha*), don’t consider in that way ( *mā evaṃ vitakkayittha*), direct your mind this way ( *evaṃ manasikarotha*), And because they do not become forgetful, those gods do not fall from that state. They are permanent ( *niccā*), stable (*dhuvā*), eternal (*sassatā*), not subject to change (*avipariṇāmadhammā*), and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted by play (*khiḍḍāpadosikā*), spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment.

They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment, so that their mindfulness is dissipated.

When we became forgetful, we passed away from that plane. Coming to this world, now we are impermanent (*aniccā*), unstable (*addhuvā*), short-lived (*appāyukā*), doomed to perish (*cavanadhammā*), and we have come to this world.

This, monks, is the second case, wherein approaching and relying on what, some ascetics and Brahmins propound that the self and the world are partly eternalists (*ekaccasassatikā*) and partly non-eternalists (*ekaccaasassatikā*), partly eternal (*sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*asassataṃ*).

47.

"And in the third case, relying on what, do some ascetics and Brahmins propound that the self and the world are partly eternalists (*ekaccasassatikā*) and partly non-eternalists (*ekaccaasassatikā*), partly eternal (*sassataṃ*) and partly non-eternal (*asassataṃ*)? There are, monks, gods called corrupted in mind (*manopadosikā*), and they contemplate each other with excessive envy.

They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy, and as a result their minds become corrupted.

When their minds are corrupted, their bodies and minds become exhausted.

And they fall from that place.

48.

"And it can happen that a being, having fallen from that state, arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth from home to homelessness, by means of effort (*ātappa*), exertion (*padhāna*), application (*anuyoga*), diligence (*appamāda*), and right attention (*sammāmanasikāra*), he attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhi*) that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life (*pubbenivāsaṃ*), but none previous to that.

"He speaks thus: ‘Those honourable gods who are not corrupted in mind (*manopadosikā*) do not contemplate each other with excessive envy.

As a result, their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another.

Their minds are not corrupted, their bodies are not weary, and their minds are not weary.

Those gods do not fall from that state. They are permanent (*niccā*), stable (*dhuvā*), eternal (*sassatā*), not subject to change (*avipariṇāmadhammā*), and they will remain the same just like eternity itself.

But we, who were corrupted in mind (*manopadosikā*), contemplated each other with excessive envy.

We spent an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy, and as a result our minds became corrupted. When our minds were corrupted, our bodies and minds became exhausted.

Thus, we have fallen from that state, we are impermanent (*aniccā*), unstable (*addhuvā*), short-lived (*appāyukā*), and subject to falling away (*cavanadhammā*), we have come to this world. Do not think in that way, abandon that, attain this and persevere in it."
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"Again, Kevaddha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha…pe… (as it should be expanded in paragraphs 190-212).
Thus, Kevaddha, a *bhikṣu* is perfected in morality...pe...enters and dwells in the first *jhāna*.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…pe… the second *jhāna*…pe… the third *jhāna*…pe… enters and dwells in the fourth *jhāna*.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction...pe... directs the mind towards knowledge and vision, inclines (the mind)…pe… This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction...pe... understands that there is nothing further here…pe… This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"These three miracles, Kevaddha, have been proclaimed by me, having realized them myself with higher knowledge."
The subject of the monk who sought the cessation of the elements.
487.
"Once, Kevaddha, in this very community of *bhikṣus*, this thought arose in the mind of a certain *bhikṣu*: 'Where, indeed, do these four great elements—the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*)—cease without remainder?'
488.
"Then, Kevaddha, that *bhikṣu* attained such a state of *samādhi* that, in his mind thus concentrated, the path to the world of the gods (*deva*) appeared.
Then, Kevaddha, that *bhikṣu* approached the gods of the Realm of the Four Great Kings (*cātumahārājika*), and having approached the gods of the *cātumahārājika*, he said to them: 'Friends (*āvusos*), where do these four great elements—the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*)—cease without remainder?'
"When this was said, Kevaddha, the *cātumahārājika* gods said to that *bhikṣu*: 'Even we, *bhikṣu*, do not know where these four great elements—the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*)—cease without remainder.
It exists, indeed (pī.
Likewise above)].
It exists, indeed [air element (*vāyo-dhātu*).
It exists, indeed (pī.
Likewise above)], *bhikṣu*, the Four Great Kings (*mahārājāno*) are more excellent than us. more surpassing and more sublime.
They may know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)."
489.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to the Four Great Kings and having approached them, said to the Four Great Kings: “Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?” When this was said, Kevatta, the Four Great Kings said to that monk: “We also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)."
But the Thirty-Three Gods, monk, are more surpassing and more sublime than we are.
They may know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)."
490.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to the Thirty-Three Gods and having approached them, said to the Thirty-Three Gods: “Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?” When this was said, Kevatta, the Thirty-Three Gods said to that monk: “We also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)."
But Sakka, the lord of the gods (*devānamindo*), monk, is more surpassing and more sublime than we are.
He may know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)."
491.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to Sakka, the lord of the gods, and having approached Sakka, the lord of the gods, said: “Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?” When this was said, Kevatta, Sakka, the lord of the gods, said to that monk: “I also, monk, I do not know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

Furthermore, monk, the Yama gods exist... Suyama, son of the gods, exists… The Tusita gods exist… Santussita, son of the gods, exists… The Nimmanarati gods exist… Sunimmita, son of the gods, exists… The Paranimmita-vasavatti gods exist… Vasavatti, son of the gods, exists, and is more eminent and refined than us.

He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

492.

Then that monk, Kevatta, approached the deva-son Vasavatti, and having approached, said this to the deva-son Vasavatti: 'Where, friend, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?' When this was said, Kevatta, the deva-son Vasavatti said this to that monk: 'I also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

Furthermore, monk, the Brahmakayika gods exist, and are more eminent and refined than us.

They would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

493.

Then that monk, Kevatta, attained to such a state of concentration (*samādhi*) that the path to the Brahma-world (*brahmayāniyo maggo*) became visible in his mind that was concentrated.

Then that monk, Kevatta, approached the Brahmakayika gods, and having approached, said this to the Brahmakayika gods: 'Where, friend, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?' When this was said, Kevatta, the Brahmakayika gods said this to that monk: 'We also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

Furthermore, monk, Brahmā, the Great Brahmā (*mahābrahmā*), the Conqueror (*abhibhū*), the Unconquered (*anabhibhūto*), the All-seeing (*aññadatthudaso*), the All-Powerful (*vasavattī*). He is the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Organizer, the Controller, the Father of Beings, loftier and more excellent than we.
He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).
“Where, friend, is the Great Brahma now?” “Monk, we do not know when, where, or how Brahma will appear. But when the signs appear—when a light is born, a radiance shines forth—then Brahma will appear. These signs are a prior indication of Brahma’s appearance: a light is born, a radiance shines forth.”
Then, the Great Brahma, Kevatta, appeared not long after.
494.
Then, Kevatta, that monk approached the Great Brahma and said to him: "Where, friend, do these four great elements—namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)—cease without remainder?" When this was said, Kevatta, the Great Brahma said to that monk: "I am, monk, Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Organizer, the Controller, the Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be."
The monk said a second time, "Friend, I am not asking whether you are Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Organizer, the Controller, the Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be."
And so I ask you, friend, where do these four great elements – namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*) – cease without remainder?"
The Great Brahma said to the monk for the second time: "I am, monk, Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Organizer, the Controller, the Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be."
The monk said to the Great Brahma for the third time: "Friend, I am not asking whether you are Brahmā, Great Brahmā, The Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.
And so, friend, I ask you, "Where do these four great elements – earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), water element (*āpodhātu*), fire element (*tejodhātu*), and air element (*vāyodhātu*) – cease without remainder?"
495.
Then, Kevatta, the Great Brahmā took that monk by the arm, led him aside and said: “Monk, these devas who belong to the assembly of Brahmā think of me in this way: ‘There is nothing that Brahmā does not know, nothing that he does not see, nothing that he is unaware of, nothing that he has not realized.’
That is why I did not speak in front of them.
And I, monk, do not know where these four great elements – earth element, water element, fire element and air element – cease without remainder.
Therefore, monk, you have acted wrongly, you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhere.
Now, monk, you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this question to him, and whatever answer he gives, accept it.”
496.
Then, Kevatta, that monk, as swiftly as a strong man might flex or extend his arm, vanished from the Brahmā world and appeared in my presence.
Then, Kevatta, that monk prostrated himself before me, then sat down to one side and said: “Lord, where do these four great elements – the earth element, the water element, the fire element and the air element – cease without remainder?”
Like the simile of the land-sighting bird.
497.
When this was said, I said to that monk, Kevatta: “Once upon a time seafaring merchants, when they set sail on the ocean, took in their ship a land-sighting bird.
When they could not see the land themselves, they released this bird.
The bird flew to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, it flew upwards, and to the intermediate directions.
If it sees land all around, it heads off in that direction.
But if it saw no land all around, it returned to the ship.
In the same way, monk, you have been as far as the Brahmā world searching for an answer to this question and not finding it, and now you come back to me.
Monk, you should not ask your question in this way: ‘Where do the four great elements – the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element – cease without remainder?’
498.
Instead, monk, this is how the question should be asked:
‘Where do water, earth, fire and air find no footing?
Where are long and short, small and great, fair and foul—
Where are name and form wholly destroyed?’”
499.
“There, the explanation is this:
‘Consciousness is invisible, endless, and all-illuminating.
That is where water, earth, fire, and air find no footing.
There, long and short, small and great, fair and foul—
There, name and form are wholly destroyed.
With the cessation of consciousness, all of this ceases.’”
500.
This is what the Blessed One said.
Kevatta, the householder’s son, was satisfied and delighted with the Blessed One’s words.
The Kevatta Discourse is finished, the eleventh. 12. The Lohicca Discourse
The Story of the Brahmin Lohicca

501. Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala, accompanied by a large Sangha of monks, about five hundred in all. He arrived at Sālavatikā.

At that time, the Brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift, a rent-free grant.

502. At that time, this wicked thought arose in the mind of the Brahmin Lohicca: "If a renunciate or a Brahmin were to attain a wholesome teaching, having attained a wholesome teaching, he should not announce it to others; for what could another do for another?

It is just as if someone, having cut an old bond, were to create a new bond. I declare that such a thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment, for what can one person do for another?"

503. Then the Brahmin Lohicca heard, "The renunciate Gotama, son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is wandering in Kosala with a large Sangha of monks, about five hundred in all, and has arrived at Sālavatikā.

And concerning the esteemed Gotama, such a good report has spread: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of beings to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed One.’

He realizes for himself with direct knowledge this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its rulers and people, and makes it known.

He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the meaning and with the letter; he reveals the spiritual life that is utterly perfect and pure.

It is good to see such accomplished Arahants."

504. Then the Brahmin Lohicca addressed the barber Rosika [Bhesika (Sī.
Pī.)]: "Come, good Rosika, go to the renunciate Gotama,

and on arrival, ask the renunciate Gotama, in my name, whether he is free from illness and affliction, healthy, strong and living comfortably, saying, 'Lohicca, good Gotama, the Brahmin, asks you whether you are free from illness and affliction, healthy, strong and living comfortably.'"

And say this: "May the esteemed Gotama accept a meal from Lohicca the Brahmin, with the Sangha of monks, tomorrow."

505. "Very well, sir," said Rosika the barber, and assenting to the Brahmin Lohicca's words, he went to the Blessed One, and on arrival, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side.

Seated at one side, Rosika the barber said to the Blessed One, "Lohicca, venerable sir, the Brahmin, asks you whether you are free from illness and affliction, healthy, strong and living comfortably, and says this: 'May the venerable Gotama accept a meal from Lohicca the Brahmin, with the Sangha of monks, tomorrow.'"

The Blessed One accepted in silence.

506. Then Rosika the barber, knowing of the Blessed One's acceptance, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and went to the Brahmin Lohicca, and on arrival, said to the Brahmin Lohicca: "I have told the Blessed One, according to your words: 'Lohicca, venerable sir, the Brahmin asks the Blessed One whether he is free from illness and affliction, healthy, strong and living comfortably, and says this: May the venerable Gotama accept a meal from Lohicca the Brahmin, with the Sangha of monks, tomorrow.'

And it has been accepted by the Blessed One."

507. Then, at the end of the night, the Brahmin Lohicca had fine foods prepared, hard and soft, in his own dwelling, and addressed the barber Rosika: "Come, good Rosika, go to the renunciate Gotama, and on arrival, inform the renunciate Gotama that it is time, saying, 'It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready.'"

"Very well, sir," said Rosika the barber, and assenting to the Brahmin Lohicca's words, he went to the Blessed One, and on arrival, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side. He stood.
Standing to one side, Rosika the barber announced the time to the Blessed One: "It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready."
508.
Then, the Blessed One, having dressed in the early morning and taken his bowl and robe, went with his order of monks to Sālavatikā.
At that time, Rosika the barber was following the Blessed One closely behind.
Then Rosika the barber said to the Blessed One: "This kind of evil view has arisen in the brahmin Lohicca: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain wholesome *dharma*, having attained wholesome *dharma*, he should not declare it to another—for what can one person do for another?
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment (*lobhadhamma*)...for what can one man do for another?'"
"It is good, venerable sir, may the Blessed One dissuade the brahmin Lohicca from these evil views."
"It may well be so, Rosika, it may well be so."
Then the Blessed One went to the dwelling of the brahmin Lohicca, and having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Lohicca the brahmin personally served the Saṃgha of monks, with the Buddha at its head, with choice hard and soft food until they were satisfied and had enough.
Lohicca Brahmana's Inquiry

509.
Then, when Lohicca the *brāhmaṇa* saw that the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, he took a low seat and sat down to one side.
The Blessed One said this to Lohicca the *brāhmaṇa*, who was sitting to one side: "Lohicca, is it true that this kind of evil view has arisen in you: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain wholesome *dharma*, having attained wholesome *dharma*, he should not declare it to another—for what can one person do for another?
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment...for what can one man do for another?'" "Yes, Master Gotama."
"What do you think, Lohicca, do you not reside at Sālavatikā?" "Yes, Master Gotama."
"If someone were to say, Lohicca: 'The *brāhmaṇa* Lohicca resides at Sālavatikā.
Lohicca alone enjoys that which arises from Sālavatikā. and that the *brāhmaṇa* should alone enjoy it, not giving anything to others."

"Would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants?"

"He would be a source of danger, reverend Gotama."

"Being a source of danger, would he be solicitous for their welfare or not?'' "Not solicitous for their welfare, reverend Gotama."

"By not being solicitous for their welfare, would he have a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettā*) for them, or of hatred?" "Of hatred, reverend Gotama."

"And in a heart of hatred, is there wrong view (*micchādiṭṭhi*) or right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*)?" "Wrong view, reverend Gotama."

"Lohicca, I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies—hell (*niraya*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoni*)."

510.

"What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside at Kasi-Kosala?" "Yes, reverend Gotama."

"Well, if anyone should say: ‘King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at Kasi-Kosala, and King Pasenadi of Kosala should alone enjoy the entire revenue that arises in Kasi-Kosala, not giving anything away to others’—

would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to those of you and the others who are King Pasenadi's tenants?"

"He would be a source of danger, reverend Gotama."

"Being a source of danger, would he be solicitous for their welfare or not?'' "Not solicitous for their welfare, reverend Gotama."

"By not being solicitous for their welfare, would he have a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettā*) for them, or of hatred?" "Of hatred, reverend Gotama."

"And in a heart of hatred, is there wrong view (*micchādiṭṭhi*) or right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*)?" "Wrong view, reverend Gotama."

"Lohicca, I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies—hell (*niraya*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoni*)."

511.

"Now surely, Lohicca, if anyone were to say: "The *brāhmaṇa* Lohicca resides at Sālavatika, and that the *brāhmaṇa* Lohicca should alone enjoy all the revenue that arises from Sālavatika, not giving anything to others"—

Anyone who speaks thus is a source of danger to those who depend on him.

Being a source of danger, he is not solicitous for their welfare, and not being solicitous for their welfare, he has a heart full of hatred; in a heart full of hatred there is wrong view (*micchādiṭṭhi*).

Even so, Lohicca, if anyone should say: "Here, If a renunciate (*śramaṇa*) or a Brahmin were to attain wholesome doctrine (*kuśalaṃ dharmaṃ adhigaccheyya*), having attained wholesome doctrine, they should not declare it to another, for what can one person do for another?

It is just as if someone, having cut through an old fetter, were to create a new fetter...

One who speaks thus is a source of danger to those young men of good family (*kulaputtā*) who, having come to the Teaching and Discipline (*dhammavinaya*) proclaimed by the Tathāgata, attain such excellent and distinguished qualities; they realize the fruit of stream-entry (*sotāpatti-phala*), they realize the fruit of once-returner (*sakadāgāmi-phala*), they realize the fruit of non-returner (*anāgāmi-phala*), they realize even *arhatship*. And to those who ripen these divine seeds (*dibbā gabbhā*) for rebirth in the divine realms (*dibbānaṃ bhavānaṃ abhinibbattiyā*), they are a source of danger. Being a source of danger, they are uncompassionate (*ahitānukampī*). In the uncompassionate, a hostile mind (*sapattakaṃ cittaṃ*) is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view (*micchādiṭṭhi*).

But I declare, Lohicca, that wrong view leads to one of two destinies: hell (*nirayaṃ*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoniṃ*).

512.

"Thus, Lohicca, if anyone were to say: "King Pasenadi of Kosala resides in Kasi-Kosala. All the income arising in Kasi-Kosala, King Pasenadi of Kosala alone should enjoy it, not giving any to others."

One who speaks thus is a source of danger to those who live in dependence on King Pasenadi of Kosala, both you and others.

Being a source of danger, they are uncompassionate. In the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view.

In the same way, Lohicca, if a renunciate or a Brahmin were to attain wholesome doctrine, having attained wholesome doctrine, they should not declare it to another, for what can one person do for another?

It is just as if... what can one person do for another?", one who speaks thus is a source of danger to those young men of good family who, having come to the Teaching and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, attain such excellent and distinguished qualities; they realize the fruit of stream-entry, they realize the fruit of once-returner, they realize the fruit of non-returner, they realize even arhatship.

And to those who ripen these divine seeds for rebirth in the divine realms, they are a source of danger. Being a source of danger, they are uncompassionate. In the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view.

But I declare, Lohicca, that wrong view leads to one of two destinies: hell or the animal realm. Three are worthy of blame.

513. "These three, Lohicca, are teachers in the world who are worthy of blame. And if someone blames such teachers, that blame is true, factual, in accordance with the Dhamma, and blameless.

Which three? Here, Lohicca, a certain teacher has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but that goal of the ascetic life is not attained by him.

And without having attained that goal of the ascetic life, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma, saying: "This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness."

His disciples do not listen, do not lend an ear, do not apply their minds to understanding, and deviate from the teacher's instruction.

He should be reproached in this way: "Venerable sir, that purpose for which you went forth from the household life into homelessness, that goal of the ascetic life has not been attained by you. And without attaining that goal of the ascetic life, you teach your disciples the Dhamma, saying, 'This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness.'"

His disciples do not listen, do not lend an ear, do not apply their minds to understanding, and deviate from the teacher's instruction.

It is just as if one were to importune a woman who is turning away or embrace one who is facing elsewhere. So do I declare this evil doctrine based on attachment: what, indeed, can one person do for another?"

This, Lohicca, is the first teacher who is worthy of blame. And if someone blames such a teacher, that blame is true, factual, in accordance with the Dhamma, and blameless.

514. "Furthermore, Lohicca, here a certain teacher has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but that goal of the ascetic life is not attained by him.

And without having attained that goal of the ascetic life, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma, saying: "This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness."

His disciples listen, lend an ear, apply their minds to understanding, and do not deviate from the teacher's instruction.

He should be reproached in this way: "Venerable sir, that purpose for which you went forth from the household life into homelessness, that goal of the ascetic life has not been attained by you.

And without attaining that goal of the ascetic life, you teach your disciples the Dhamma, saying, 'This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness.'"

His disciples listen, lend an ear, apply their minds to understanding, and do not deviate from the teacher's instruction.

It is as if one were to neglect one's own field and think that another's field needs weeding. And after I made this resolution.
This, monks, is the third case, whereby some ascetics and Brahmins are partly eternalists and partly non-eternalists, and proclaim the self (ātman) and the world (loka) to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.
49.
“In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and Brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and non-eternalists in regard to other things, proclaiming the self (ātman) and the world (loka)? Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a reasoner and an investigator.
He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: ‘That which is called “the eye (cakṣu),” “the ear (śrotra),” “the nose (ghrāṇa),” “the tongue (jihvā),” and “the body (kāya)”—that self (ātman) is impermanent (anitya), unstable (adhruva), non-eternal (aśāśvata), subject to change (vipariṇāmadharma).
But that which is called “mind (citta)” or “mentality (manas)” or “consciousness (vijñāna)” —that self (ātman) is permanent (nitya), stable (dhruva), eternal (śāśvata), not subject to change (avipariṇāmadharma), and it will remain the same just like eternity (śāśvatisama) itself.’
This, monks, is the fourth case, whereby some ascetics and Brahmins are partly eternalists and partly non-eternalists, and proclaim the self (ātman) and the world (loka).
50.
“It is on these four grounds, monks, that those recluses and Brahmins who are partial-eternalists proclaim the self (ātman) and the world (loka) to be partly eternal and partly non-eternal.
Whatever ascetics and Brahmins… proclaim the partial eternity and the partial non-eternity of the self (ātman) and the world (loka), they do so on one or other of these four grounds. There is no other way.
51.
“This, monks, the *Tathāgata* understands … ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.
This the *Tathāgata* knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (nirvāna).
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings (vedanā), their satisfaction, their unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from them, the *Tathāgata*, monks, is emancipated through non-clinging.
52.
“These are those *dharmas*, monks, that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*
having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.
The doctrine of the finite and the infinite (antānantavāda).
53.
“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are extensionists, and who on four grounds proclaim the world (loka) to be finite or infinite.
And those honourable ascetics and Brahmins, owing to what, with reference to what, are extensionists, proclaiming the world (loka) to be finite or infinite on four grounds?
54.
“Herein, monks, a certain recluse or a Brahmin, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world (loka) as finite.
He speaks thus: ‘The world (loka) is finite and bounded by a circle.
What is the reason for that? Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world (loka) as finite.
Therefore I know that this world (loka) is finite and bounded by a circle.”
This is the first case, whereby some ascetics and Brahmins are extensionists, proclaiming the world (loka) to be finite or infinite.
55.
“And in the second case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and Brahmins extensionists, proclaiming the world (loka) to be finite or infinite? Herein, monks, a certain recluse or a Brahmin, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, diligence, and right reflection, attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world (loka) as infinite.
He speaks thus: ‘The world (loka) is infinite and boundless.
Those ascetics and Brahmins who declare the world (loka) to be finite and bounded speak falsely;
The world (loka) is infinite and boundless.
What is the reason for that? Because I attain to such concentration of mind As if, leaving his own field, he should think another’s field in need of weeding. I declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment… for what can one man do for another?

This, Lohicca, is the second teacher who is blameworthy. And if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is true, in accordance with reality, righteous, and faultless.

515.

Furthermore, Lohicca, here a certain teacher has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, and he has attained the goal of asceticism (*sāmaññattha*).

But without having attained that goal of asceticism, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma, saying: "This is for your good, this is for your happiness."

His disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not focus their minds, and they turn away from the Teacher's Dispensation (*satthusāsanā*).

He should be blamed, saying: "Venerable one, you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but you have not attained that goal of asceticism (*sāmaññattha*).

Without having attained that goal of asceticism (*sāmaññattha*), you teach your disciples the *Dhamma*, saying: ‘This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness.’

Your disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not focus their minds, and they turn away from the Teacher's Dispensation (*satthusāsanā*).

Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?"

This, Lohicca, is the third teacher who is blameworthy. And if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is true, in accordance with reality, righteous, and faultless.

These, Lohicca, are the three teachers who are blameworthy, and if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is true, in accordance with reality, righteous, and faultless.

A teacher not worthy of blame

516.

When this was said, Lohicca the Brahmin said to the Blessed One: "Is there, venerable Gotama, any teacher who is not blameworthy in the world?" "There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world."

"Which one, venerable Gotama, is that teacher who is not blameworthy in the world?"

"Here, Lohicca, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arahant*, a fully enlightened *Buddha*... (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).

Thus, Lohicca, a *bhikkhu*

is accomplished in moral discipline (*sīlasampanno*)... He enters and abides in the first *jhāna*... Whenever, Lohicca, a disciple of a teacher attains such excellent distinction, this, Lohicca, is a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world.

And if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is untrue, not in accordance with reality, unrighteous, and faulty... He enters and abides in the second *jhāna*... third *jhāna*... fourth *jhāna*.

Whenever, Lohicca, a disciple of a teacher attains such excellent distinction, this, Lohicca, is a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world, and if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is untrue, not in accordance with reality, unrighteous, and faulty… he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision… Whenever, Lohicca, a disciple of a teacher attains such excellent distinction, this, Lohicca, is a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world, and if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is untrue, not in accordance with reality, unrighteous, and faulty… he understands, ‘There is no more beyond this.’

Whenever, Lohicca, a disciple of a teacher attains such excellent distinction, this, Lohicca, is a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world, and if anyone blames that kind of teacher, that blame is untrue, not in accordance with reality, unrighteous, and faulty."

517.

When this was said, Lohicca the Brahmin said to the Blessed One: "It is as if, venerable Gotama, a man were to seize another man who was falling into a pit of hell by the hair, lift him up, and set him on dry ground. Just so, I have been lifted up by you, venerable Gotama, as I was falling into a pit of hell, and set on dry ground.

Excellent, venerable Gotama, excellent, venerable Gotama! It is as if, venerable Gotama, one were to set upright what had been overturned, or to reveal what was hidden, or to point out the way to one who was lost, or to hold up an oil lamp in the darkness, so that those with eyes might see forms.

In this way, venerable Gotama, the *Dhamma* has been made clear in many ways.

I go to the venerable Gotama for refuge, and to the *Dhamma*, and to the *Saṃgha* of *bhikkhus*.

May the venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower (*upāsaka*) who has taken refuge from today onwards, for as long as life shall last."

The Lohicca *Sutta*, the twelfth, is finished. 13. The Tevijja Sutta

518. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala with a large Saṅgha of monks, about five hundred in all. He arrived at a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasākaṭa.

The Blessed One stayed near Manasākaṭa, in a mango grove on the bank of the Aciravatī River, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

519. Now at that time, numerous well-known and wealthy Brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa, namely, the Brahmin Caṅkī, the Brahmin Tārukkha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the Brahmin Todeyya, and other well-known and wealthy Brahmins.

520. Then, as the two Brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were out for a walk, a discussion arose between them about the true path and the false path.

Then the Brahmin student Vāseṭṭha said thus: “This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti.”

The Brahmin student Bhāradvāja also said thus: “This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.”

Vāseṭṭha was unable to convince the Brahmin student Bhāradvāja, nor was Bhāradvāja able to convince Vāseṭṭha.

521. Then the Brahmin student Vāseṭṭha addressed the Brahmin student Bhāradvāja, saying: “This ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying in Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove on the bank of the Aciravatī River, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

Now a good report of the Blessed Gotama has spread about, saying: ‘Thus indeed, that Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of those who can be taught, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’

Come, Bhāradvāja, let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about this matter. Whatever the ascetic Gotama explains to us, so shall we remember it.”

“Very well, friend,” the Brahmin student Bhāradvāja replied to the Brahmin student Vāseṭṭha.

The discussion of the true and untrue path.

522. Then the Brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja went to where the Blessed One was. Having approached, they exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One.

After an exchange of polite and courteous greetings, they sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Brahmin student Vāseṭṭha said this to the Blessed One: “Here, Reverend Gotama, as we were out for a walk, a discussion arose between us about the true path and the untrue path.

I say thus: ‘This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti.’

The Brahmin Bhāradvāja says thus: ‘This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.’

In this matter, Reverend Gotama, there is disagreement, there is dispute, there is divergence of views.”

523. “So, Vāseṭṭha, is this what you say: ‘This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti’?”

The Brahmin Bhāradvāja says thus: ‘This alone is the direct path, this is the straightforward way that leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.’

What then, Vāseṭṭha, is the subject of your disagreement, of your dispute, of your divergence of views?”

524. “The true path and the untrue path, Reverend Gotama.

Even though, Reverend Gotama, the Brahmins teach various paths – the Adhvariya Brahmins, the Tittiriya Brahmins, the Chandoka Brahmins, the Bavhārijjha Brahmins – do all those paths lead to union with Brahmā?" Just as if, Reverend Gotama, there were near a town or village many different paths, and all these come together at that village; even so, Reverend Gotama, although the *brāhmaṇas* propound different paths—the Adhvariya *brāhmaṇas*, the Tittiriya *brāhmaṇas*, the Chandoka *brāhmaṇas*, the Bavhārijjhā *brāhmaṇas*—do all these paths lead the one who follows them to union with Brahmā?
The Discourse to Vāseṭṭha about the Youths
525.
“Do you say ‘they lead’, Vāseṭṭha?”
“I say, ‘they lead’, Reverend Gotama.”
“Do you say, ‘they lead,’ Vāseṭṭha?”
“I say, ‘they lead,’ Reverend Gotama.”
“Do you say, ‘they lead,’ Vāseṭṭha?”
“I say, ‘they lead,’ Reverend Gotama.”
“But, Vāseṭṭha, is there then a single one of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*) who has seen Brahmā face to face?”
“No, Reverend Gotama.”
“Then has the teacher of any one of them seen Brahmā face to face?”
“No, Reverend Gotama.”
“Then has the teacher’s teacher of any one of them seen Brahmā face to face?”
“No, Reverend Gotama.”
“Then has the ancestor seven generations back of the teacher of one of them seen Brahmā face to face?”
“No, Reverend Gotama.”
526.
“Well then, Vāseṭṭha, what about the early *ṛṣis* of those *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*), the makers of the *mantras*, the expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the *brāhmaṇas* of today, and sung and spoken about—such as Aṣṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—did even they say: ‘We know this, we see this: when, how and where Brahmā appears’?”
“No, Reverend Gotama.”
527.
“So, Vāseṭṭha, not one of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*) has seen Brahmā face to face.
Nor has one of their teachers,
nor even the teacher's teacher,
nor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers.
Nor could any of the early *ṛṣis* of those *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*), the makers of the *mantras*, the expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the *brāhmaṇas* of today, and sung and spoken about—such as Aṣṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—say: ‘We know this, we see this: when, how and where Brahmā appears’.”
Yet these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjā brāhmaṇā*) say: “We teach this path to union with Brahmā, whom we do not know and have not seen.
This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahmā.”
528.
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*) declare turn out to be ill-founded?”
“Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*) declare does turn out to be ill-founded.”
“That is right, Vāseṭṭha. When these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjā brāhmaṇā*) teach a path that they do not know and see, saying:
‘This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahmā,’ this cannot possibly be right.
529.
Just as a file of blind men go on, clinging to each other, and the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, and the last one sees nothing—
so it is with the talk of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*): the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, the last one sees nothing.
The talk of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas (*tevijjānaṃ brāhmaṇānaṃ*) turns out to be laughable, mere words, empty and vain. 530.
'What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the moon and sun, just as other people do, and when the moon and sun rise and set, do they pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands, and circumambulate?'
'Yes, Reverend Gotama, the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the moon and sun, just as other people do, and when the moon and sun rise and set, they pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands, and circumambulate.'

531.
'What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Can these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who see the moon and sun just as other people do, point out a way to union with the moon and sun, saying: "This is the only straight path, this is the direct way, which leads to union with the moon and sun for whoever practices it?"'
'No, Reverend Gotama.'
'So, Vāseṭṭha, these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas cannot point out a way to union with the moon and sun, which they have seen, saying: "This is the only straight path, this is the direct way, which leads to union with the moon and sun for whoever practices it."'

532.
'Thus, indeed, the Brahmā has not been seen face-to-face by the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas.
Nor has Brahmā been seen face-to-face by the teachers of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas.
Nor has Brahmā been seen face-to-face by the teachers of the teachers of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas.
Nor has Brahmā been seen face-to-face by the most ancient teachers, going back even seven generations, of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas.
And those ancient *ṛṣis* (seers) of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, the creators of the *mantras* (hymns), the expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient *mantra-pada* (words of the hymns) is chanted, uttered, and compiled by the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas of today, they also sing after, they also speak after, they also repeat what was spoken, they also cause to recite what was recited, namely: Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu, even they did not say, "We know this, we see this, where Brahmā is, by whom Brahmā is, and in whom Brahmā is."
The Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declared thus: "We teach the path to union with that which we neither know nor see – this alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape, leading to union with Brahmā for one who acts accordingly."
533.
"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declare turn out to be unfounded?" "Indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declare turns out to be unfounded."
"Well done, Vāseṭṭha! Indeed, Vāseṭṭha, the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas, not knowing, not seeing, will teach the path to union with that – 'This alone is the straight path, this the direct way, the means of escape, leading to union with Brahmā for one who acts accordingly' – such a thing cannot be."
The simile of the beautiful woman of the country.
534.
"It is just as if, Vāseṭṭha, a man were to say thus: 'I desire, I long for the most beautiful woman in this country.'"
They might say to him thus: "Good man, this most beautiful woman in the country whom you desire and long for, do you know whether she is a noblewoman, a *brāhmaṇa* woman, a *vessa* woman, or a *sudda* woman?" Asked thus, he would say, "No."
"They might say to him thus: "Good man, this most beautiful woman in the country whom you desire and long for, do you know her name, her clan, whether she is tall, short, or of medium height, dark, fair, or of golden skin, or in what village, town, or city she dwells?" Asked thus, he would say, "No."
They might say to him thus: "Good man, you desire and long for someone you neither know nor see?" Asked thus, he would say, "Yes."
535.
"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not the speech of that man turn out to be groundless?" "Indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, the speech of that man turns out to be groundless."
536.
"Even so, Vāseṭṭha, not one of the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face, nor has any of their teachers, nor any of the teachers of their teachers.
Not even the ancestor seven generations back of the teachers of the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face.
Those former sages of the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas, the composers of the *mantras*, the founders of the *mantras*, those whose ancient verses, words of *mantras*, chanted, uttered, and compiled, are now chanted, repeated, reiterated, and recited by the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas—such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—even they did not say, "We know this, we see this, where Brahmā is, by whom Brahmā is, and in whom Brahmā is."
The Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declared thus: "We teach the path to union with that which we neither know nor see – this alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape, leading to union with Brahmā for one who acts accordingly."
537.
"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declare turn out to be unfounded?" "Indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these Brahmins versed in the three Vedas declare turns out to be unfounded."
"Well done, Vāseṭṭha! Indeed, Vāseṭṭha, the Brahmins versed in the three Vedas, not knowing, not seeing, will teach the path to union with that – 'This alone is the straight path, this the direct way, the means of escape, leading to union with Brahmā for one who acts accordingly' – such a thing cannot be."
The Simile of the Staircase.
538.
"It is just as if, Vāseṭṭha, a man were to make a staircase at a crossroads for ascending to a palace.
They might say to him thus: "Good man, this staircase you are making for ascending to a palace, do you know where that palace is, whether it is to the east, to the south, "Whether it will face the western direction or the northern direction, whether it will be high or low or of medium height?" Thus asked, he would answer "no."

"Then they might say to him thus: 'Hey fellow, you do not know or see for what palace you are building the staircase!' " Thus asked, he would answer "yes."

539.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? When this is the case, doesn't the talk of that man turn out to be unconvincing?" "Certainly, venerable Gotama, when this is the case, the talk of that man turns out to be unconvincing."

540.

"Just so, Vāseṭṭha, not even one of the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas has directly seen Brahmā, nor have their teachers, nor their teachers' teachers, nor even the seventh generation of teachers back.

And the ancient sages of the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas, the composers and propagators of the hymns, whose ancient hymn verses the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas nowadays still chant, repeat, recite, and cause to be recited, such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu – even they did not say thus: 'We know this, we see this: where Brahmā is, how Brahmā is, and in what place Brahmā is.'

Instead, the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas say thus: 'We do not know, we do not see, but we teach the path to union with that. This is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape, it leads him who acts according to it to union with Brahmā.' "

541.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? When this is the case, doesn't the talk of the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas turn out to be unconvincing?" "Certainly, venerable Gotama, when this is the case, the talk of the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas turns out to be unconvincing."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha.

Indeed, Vāseṭṭha, the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas, not knowing or seeing, will teach the path to union with that.

'This is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape, it leads him who acts according to it to union with Brahmā' - this is not possible."

The simile of the Aciravatī River

542.

"Just as, Vāseṭṭha, this Aciravatī River is full of water, level with the banks, and a crow can drink from it.

And a man should come along wishing to cross over, to get to the other side, to get across.

Standing on this bank, he should call out to the other bank: 'Come here, far bank, come here!'

543.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, would the far bank of the Aciravatī River come over to this bank because of that man's calling, begging, wishing, or praising?" "No, venerable Gotama."

544.

"Just so, Vāseṭṭha, the Brahmins learned in the three Vedas, neglecting those things that make one a Brahmin and engaging in those things that do not make one a Brahmin, say thus: 'We call upon Indra, we call upon Soma, we call upon Varuṇa, we call upon Īsāna, we call upon Prajāpati, we call upon Brahmā, we call upon Mahiddhi, we call upon Yama.'

"Indeed, Vāseṭṭha, those Brahmins learned in the three Vedas who, neglecting those things that make one a Brahmin and engaging in those things that do not make one a Brahmin, would, as a result of calling, begging, wishing, or praising, after the break-up of the body, after death, attain union with Brahmā – this is not possible.

545.

"Just as, Vāseṭṭha, this Aciravatī River is full of water, level with the banks, and a crow can drink from it.

And a man should come along wishing to cross over, to get to the other side, to get across.

But he is bound on this bank with a strong chain, his hands behind his back, tightly bound.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, would that man be able to cross from this bank of the Aciravatī River to the far bank?" "No, venerable Gotama." 546.
‘In just the same way, Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguṇā) are called bonds and fetters.

Which five? Forms (rūpā) cognizable by the eye (cakkhuviññeyyā) that are wished for (iṭṭhā), desired (kantā), agreeable (manāpā), and likeable (piyarūpā), connected with sensual desire (kāmūpasaṃhitā) and provocative of lust (rajanīyā);

Sounds (saddā) cognizable by the ear (sotaviññeyyā)…; Odours (gandhā) cognizable by the nose (ghānaviññeyyā)…; Flavours (rasā) cognizable by the tongue (jivhāviññeyyā)…; Tangibles (phoṭṭhabbā) cognizable by the body (kāyaviññeyyā) that are wished for (iṭṭhā), desired (kantā), agreeable (manāpā), and likeable (piyarūpā), connected with sensual desire (kāmūpasaṃhitā) and provocative of lust (rajanīyā).

These five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguṇā), Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fetters.

And, Vāseṭṭha, those Brahmins (brāhmaṇā) learned in the Three Vedas (tevijjā) are enslaved (gadhitā), infatuated (mucchitā) by these five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguṇe), which they enjoy guiltily (ajjhopannā), unaware of danger (anādīnavadassāvino), knowing no way out (anissaraṇapaññā).

‘But that such Brahmins (brāhmaṇā), learned in the Three Vedas (tevijjā), who persistently neglect what a Brahmin (brāhmaṇakārakā) should do (dhammā),… who are enslaved (gadhitā), infatuated (mucchitā) by these five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguṇe),… knowing no way out (anissaraṇapaññā), should attain after death (maraṇā), at the break­ing-up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), to union with Brahma (brahmānaṃ sahabyūpagā) — that is just not possible (netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati).

547.
‘It is just as if this River Aciravatī (aciravatī nadī) were brimful (pūrā) of water (udakassa) so that a crow could drink out of it (samatittikā kākapeyyā).

And a man (puriso) should come along (āgaccheyya) wishing to cross over (taritukāmo), to get to the other side (pāragāmī), to get across (pāragavesī),

and were to lie down (nipajjeyya) on this bank (orime tīre), covering his head (sasīsaṃ pārupitvā) with a shawl.

What do you think (taṃ kiṃ maññasi), Vāseṭṭha? Would that man (puriso) be able to get to the other side (pārimaṃ tīraṃ gaccheyyā) of the River Aciravatī (aciravatiyā nadiyā) from this bank (orimā tīrā)?" "No, Gotama (gotama)".

548.
‘In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances (pañcime nīvaraṇā) are called obstacles (āvaraṇātipi vuccanti), hindrances (nīvaraṇātipi vuccanti), coverings-up (onāhanātipi vuccanti), envelopings (pariyonāhanātipi vuccanti).

Which five? Sensual desire (kāmacchandanīvaraṇaṃ), ill will (byāpādanīvaraṇaṃ), sloth and drowsiness (thinamiddhanīvaraṇaṃ), restlessness and anxiety (uddhaccakukkuccanīvaraṇaṃ), and uncertainty (vicikicchānīvaraṇaṃ).

These five hindrances (pañca nīvaraṇā), Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline are called obstacles (āvaraṇātipi vuccanti), hindrances (nīvaraṇātipi vuccanti), coverings-up (onāhanātipi vuccanti), envelopings (pariyonāhanātipi vuccanti).

549.
And these Brahmins (brāhmaṇā) learned in the Three Vedas (tevijjā) are caught up (āvuṭā), hemmed in (nivuṭā), obstructed (onaddhā), entangled (pariyonaddhā) in these five hindrances (pañcahi nīvaraṇehi).

Those Brahmins (brāhmaṇā) learned in the Three Vedas (tevijjā) Those things which are conducive to being a *brāhmaṇa*, abandoning those things, and behaving; those things which are not conducive to being a *brāhmaṇa*, taking up those things and behaving; being obstructed, hindered, tied, and completely tied by the five hindrances; at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will attain union with Brahmā—such a thing is not possible.

A discussion of communion.

550.

“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? What have you heard said by *brāhmaṇas* who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Is Brahmā encumbered with wives and wealth, or unencumbered?” “Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama.”

“Is he full of hate or without hate?” “Without hate, Reverend Gotama.”

“Is he full of ill-will or without ill-will?” “Without ill-will, Reverend Gotama.”

“Is he impure or pure?” “Pure, Reverend Gotama.”

“Is he disciplined or undisciplined?” “Disciplined, Reverend Gotama.”

“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Are the *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas encumbered with wives and wealth, or unencumbered?” “Encumbered, Reverend Gotama.”

“Are they full of hate or without hate?” “Full of hate, Reverend Gotama.”

“Are they full of ill-will or without ill-will?” “Full of ill-will, Reverend Gotama.”

“Are they impure or pure?” “Impure, Reverend Gotama.”

“Are they disciplined or undisciplined?” “Undisciplined, Reverend Gotama.”

551.

“So, Vāseṭṭha, the *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered with wives and wealth, and Brahmā is unencumbered.

Is there any communion, anything in common between these encumbered *brāhmaṇas* and the unencumbered Brahmā?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”

“That is right, Vāseṭṭha. That these encumbered *brāhmaṇas*, learned in the Three Vedas, should after death, at the breaking-up of the body, be united with the unencumbered Brahmā—that is just not possible.

Likewise, do these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas and full of hate…, full of ill-will…, impure…, undisciplined, have any communion, anything in common with the disciplined Brahmā?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”

“That is right, Vāseṭṭha. That these undisciplined *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas, should after death be united with the disciplined Brahmā is just not possible.

552.

But these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas, having sat down on the bank, sink down despairingly, thinking maybe to find a dry way across.

Therefore their threefold knowledge is called the threefold desert, the threefold wilderness, the threefold destruction.”

553.

At these words Vāseṭṭha said: ‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard them say: “The ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with Brahmā.”’

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?

Is Manasakata near from here, or is Manasakata not far from here?" "Yes, Reverend Gotama, Manasakata is near from here, not far from here".

554.

“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasakata,

and somebody who had come from Manasakata and and had missed the road should ask him the way.

Would that man, bom and bred in Manasakata, be in a state of confusion or perplexity?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”

“What is the reason for that?” “Because such a man would know all the paths.”

Vāseṭṭha, it might be said that such a man on being asked the way might be confused or perplexed—but the *Tathāgata*, on being asked about the Brahma world and the way to get there, would certainly not be confused or perplexed.
"For, Vāseṭṭha, I know Brahmā (brahmānaṃ) and the world of Brahmā (brahmalokañca), and the path of practice (paṭipadaṃ) leading to the world of Brahmā (brahmalokagāminiñca), and how one who has practiced attains to the world of Brahmā (brahmalokaṃ upapanno), that too I know (tañca pajānāmī"ti)." 555.

When this was said, the student Vāseṭṭha said this to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama teaches the path to companionship with Brahmā.”

“It would be good if the esteemed Gotama would teach the path to companionship with Brahmā! May the esteemed Gotama lift up the Brahma community!”

“Then, Vāseṭṭha, listen, pay close attention, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” the student Vāseṭṭha replied to the Blessed One.

Teaching the Path to the Realm of Brahmā

556.

The Blessed One said this: “Here, Vāseṭṭha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one, a rightly self-awakened one…pe… (as it should be expanded as in paragraphs 190-212).

"This is how, Vāseṭṭha, a *bhikkhu* is accomplished in virtue…pe… When he sees that these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, joy arises. When he is joyful, rapture arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil. With a tranquil body, he experiences happiness. Being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.

“He dwells pervading one direction with a mind accompanied by loving-kindness (*mettā*).

Likewise the second direction.

Likewise the third direction.

Likewise the fourth direction.

Thus, above, below, across, everywhere, completely, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by loving-kindness, vast, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill-will.

“Just as, Vāseṭṭha, a strong trumpeter could easily make himself heard in the four directions, so too, Vāseṭṭha, with the mind-deliverance of *mettā* developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there.

This too, Vāseṭṭha, is the path to companionship with Brahmā.

“Furthermore, Vāseṭṭha, a *bhikkhu* dwells pervading one direction with a mind accompanied by compassion (*karuṇā*)…pe… with a mind accompanied by sympathetic joy (*muditā*)…pe… with a mind accompanied by equanimity (*upekkhā*).

Likewise the second direction.

Likewise the third direction.

Likewise the fourth direction.

Thus, above, below, across, everywhere, completely, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind accompanied by equanimity, vast, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill-will.

“Just as, Vāseṭṭha, a strong trumpeter could easily make himself heard in the four directions.

So too, Vāseṭṭha, with the mind-deliverance of *upekkhā* developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there.

This, Vāseṭṭha, is the path to companionship with Brahmā.

557.

“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, is a *bhikkhu* living in this way encumbered or unencumbered?” “Unencumbered, Master Gotama.”

“With hatred or without hatred?” “Without hatred, Master Gotama.”

“With ill-will or without ill-will?” “Without ill-will, Master Gotama.”

“Defiled or undefiled?” “Undefiled, Master Gotama.”

“Disciplined or undisciplined?” “Disciplined, Master Gotama.”

“Thus, Vāseṭṭha, the *bhikkhu* is unencumbered, and Brahmā is unencumbered.

Does that unencumbered *bhikkhu* have anything in common with the unencumbered Brahmā?” “Yes, Master Gotama.”

“Good, Vāseṭṭha! Then, Vāseṭṭha, it is possible that an unencumbered *bhikkhu*, after death, at the breaking up of the body, will attain companionship with the unencumbered Brahmā—this possibility exists.”

558.

“Thus, Vāseṭṭha, the *bhikkhu* is without hatred, and Brahmā is without hatred…pe… the *bhikkhu* is without ill-will, and Brahmā is without ill-will… the *bhikkhu* is undefiled, and Brahmā is undefiled… the *bhikkhu* is disciplined, and Brahmā is disciplined. Does that disciplined *bhikkhu* have anything in common with the disciplined Brahmā?” “Yes, Master Gotama.”

“Good, Vāseṭṭha! Then, Vāseṭṭha, it is possible that a disciplined *bhikkhu*, after death, at the breaking up of the body, will attain companionship with the disciplined Brahmā—this possibility exists.”

559.

When this was said, the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama, excellent, Master Gotama! It is as if, Master Gotama, someone were to set upright what was overturned, or to reveal what was hidden, or to show the way to one who was lost, or to hold up an oil lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see forms.

In this way, Master Gotama, the Dharma I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as infinite.
Therefore I know that this world is infinite and unbounded.
This, mendicants, is the second case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, with this as their basis, they assert the world is both finite and infinite.
56.
“And what is the third case by which some ascetics and Brahmins assert the world is both finite and infinite? Here, mendicants, a certain ascetic or Brahmin—by ardour, endeavor, application, diligence, and right attention—attains such concentration of mind that, when the mind is immersed in samādhi, they abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
He thinks: “The world is finite and infinite.”
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is finite and bounded by a circle” are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is infinite and unbounded” are also wrong.
The world is finite and infinite.
Why is that? Because—by ardour, endeavor, application, diligence, and right attention—I attain such concentration of mind that, when the mind is immersed in *samādhi*, I abide perceiving the world as finite up and down, and as infinite across.
Therefore I know that the world is both finite and infinite.
This, mendicants, is the third case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, with this as their basis, they assert the world is both finite and infinite.
57.
“And what is the fourth case by which some ascetics and Brahmins assert the world is both finite and infinite? Here, mendicants, a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician and an inquirer.
They declare their view—hammered out by reason, deduced from their investigations, following their own train of thought—thus: ‘The world is neither finite nor infinite.’
Those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is finite and bounded by a circle” are wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is infinite and unbounded” are also wrong.
And those ascetics and Brahmins who say: “The world is finite and infinite” are all wrong.
The world is neither
finite nor infinite.’
This, mendicants, is the fourth case. When some ascetics and Brahmins rely on this, with this as their basis, they assert the world is both finite and infinite.
58.
It is on these four grounds that those ascetics and Brahmins are extensionists, and proclaim the finitude and infinitude of the world.
Whatever ascetics or Brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite, all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.
59.
This, mendicants, the *Tathāgata* understands: ‘These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such-and-such destinations in another world.
This the *Tathāgata* knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace.
And having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings, their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them, the *Tathāgata*, mendicants, is liberated without remainder.
60.
“These are those *dharmas*, mendicants, that are deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.
Eel-Wriggling
61.
“There are, mendicants, some ascetics and Brahmins who are Eel-Wrigglers. When asked about this or that matter, they resort to evasive statements, and they wriggle like eels on four grounds.
And owing to what, with reference to what, do these honorable ascetics and Brahmins wriggle like eels, and when asked about this or that matter, resort to evasive statements, and wriggle like eels on four grounds?
62.
“Here, mendicants, a certain ascetic or Brahmin doesn’t truly know what is skillful and what is unskillful.
They think: ‘I don’t truly know what is skillful and what is unskillful.
If I Not knowing what is truly wholesome (*kusala*), and not knowing what is truly unwholesome (*akuśala*), I might declare, 'This is wholesome,' or 'This is unwholesome,' and that would be a lie for me.

If my declaration should be false, that would distress me.

And if I were distressed, that would be an obstacle for me.

Therefore, out of fear and loathing of making a false statement, he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome. But when he is questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: "I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that."

This, monks, is the first instance where, based on what they have come to and what they have undertaken, some ascetics and Brahmins, being eel-wrigglers, when questioned about this or that point, resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation.

63.

"And again, venerable monks, based on what have those ascetics and Brahmins become eel-wrigglers, and when questioned about this or that point, resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation? Here, monks, some ascetic or Brahmin does not truly understand what is wholesome (*kusala*), and does not truly understand what is unwholesome (*akuśala*).

He thinks: 'I do not truly know what is wholesome, and I do not truly know what is unwholesome.'

If, without understanding, I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome, desire or lust, hatred or aversion might arise in me.

If desire, lust, hatred, or aversion should arise in me, that would be clinging (*upādāna*) on my part.

If I felt attachment, that would distress me.

And if I were distressed, that would be an obstacle for me.”

Therefore, out of fear and loathing of clinging (*upādāna*), he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome. But when he is questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: 'I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.'

This, monks, is the second instance where, based on what they have come to and what they have undertaken, some ascetics and Brahmins Endless equivocators, when questioned about this or that point, resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation.
64.
"In the third case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators, resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation? Here, bhikkhus, some recluse or brahmin does not understand as it really is what is *kusala* (wholesome), and does not understand as it really is what is *akusala* (unwholesome).
He thinks: ‘I do not in truth know whether this is *kusala* (good) or whether this is *akusala* (bad).
If, without understanding, I were to declare something to be *kusala* (wholesome) or *akusala* (unwholesome).
Now, there are recluses and brahmins who are wise, clever, experienced in controversy, who wander about demolishing the views of others with their wisdom. If, without understanding, I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome, they might cross-examine me about my views, press me for reasons and refute my statements.
If they should do so, I might not be able to reply.
Not being able to reply would distress me.
And that distress would be an obstacle for me.’
Therefore, out of fear and loathing of being cross-examined, he does not declare anything to be *kusala* (wholesome) or *akusala* (unwholesome). But, when questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.’
This, bhikkhus, is the third case, owing to which, with reference to which, some recluses and brahmins are endless equivocators, resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation.
65.
"In the fourth case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators, resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation? Here, bhikkhus, some recluse or brahmin is dull and stupid.
Due to his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: ‘If you ask me whether there is a world beyond—if I thought there is another world, I would declare that there is. But I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that.’ If I were to think so, I would declare, "There is another world." But I don’t say so. And I don’t say otherwise. And I don’t say it is not, and I don’t not say it is not.’
‘There is no other world…and so on… ‘There both is and is not another world…and so on… ‘There neither is nor is not another world…and so on… ‘There are beings who are spontaneously born…and so on… ‘There are no beings who are spontaneously born…and so on… ‘There both are and are not beings who are spontaneously born…and so on… ‘There neither are nor are not beings who are spontaneously born…and so on… ‘There is fruit and result of good and bad actions ( *sukata-dukkata-karma*)…and so on… ‘There is no fruit and result of good and bad actions…and so on… ‘There both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad actions…and so on… ‘There neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad actions…and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* exists after death…and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* does not exist after death…and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* both exists and does not exist after death…and so on… ‘The *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death—if you ask me this, and if I were to think that the *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death, then I would declare this to you. But I don’t say so. And I don’t say otherwise. And I don’t say it is not, and I don’t not say it is not.’

This, *bhikkhus*, is the fourth case, on which those ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* who are eel-wrigglers, when questioned on this or that point, resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation.

66.

"It is on these four grounds, *bhikkhus*, that those ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* who are endless equivocators resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation when questioned about this or that point.

Whatever ascetics or *Brāhmaṇas* there may be, *bhikkhus*, who are eel-wrigglers, when questioned on this or that point, resort to evasive statements and endless equivocation, all of them do so on these four grounds, or on one of these. There is none outside of these…and so on… it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of fortuitous origination

67.

"There are, *bhikkhus*, some ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* who are fortuitous originationists, and who on two grounds proclaim the self (*ātman*) and the world to originate fortuitously.

And those venerable ones... These two followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of *bhikkhus*.
This was our discussion, venerable sir, that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived.

5. "Monks, if others should speak disparagingly of me, or disparagingly of the *Dhamma*, or disparagingly of the *Sangha*, you should not harbor resentment, displeasure, or mental animosity towards them.
Monks, if others should speak disparagingly of me, or disparagingly of the *Dhamma*, or disparagingly of the *Sangha*, if you were to be angry or displeased, that would only be an obstacle for you.
Monks, if others should speak disparagingly of me, or disparagingly of the *Dhamma*, or disparagingly of the *Sangha*, if you were to be angry or displeased, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?" "No, venerable sir."
"Monks, if others should speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the *Dhamma*, or in dispraise of the *Sangha*, you should unravel what is false and point it out as false, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is false, this is untrue, there is no such thing in us, this is not found among us.'"

6. "Monks, if others should speak in praise of me, or in praise of the *Dhamma*, or in praise of the *Sangha*, you should not give way to joy (*ānanda*), gladness (*somanassa*), or mental elation.
Monks, if others should speak in praise of me, or in praise of the *Dhamma*, or in praise of the *Sangha*, if you were to be joyful, cheerful, and elated, that would only be an obstacle for you.
Monks, if others should speak in praise of me, or in praise of the *Dhamma*, or in praise of the *Sangha*, you should acknowledge what is factual as factual, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is a fact, this is true, there is such a thing in us, this is found among us.'"
The Lesser Morality (*cūḷasīlaṃ*)

7. "It is, monks, only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue (*sīla*), that a worldling (*puthujjano*) would refer when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.
And what are those trifling and insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue (*sīla*), to which he would refer? Recluses and brahmins, owing to what, with reference to what, are some fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously on two grounds?

68.
“There are, monks, certain gods called ‘non-percipient beings.’

As soon as a perception arises in them, those *devas* fall from that realm.

And it may happen that a being falls from that realm and arises in this world.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls the arising of perception, but recalls none before that.

He speaks thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

What is the reason for that? Before this I did not exist. Now from not-being I have been brought to being.”

This, monks, is the first reason, owing to which, with reference to which, some recluses and brahmins, being fortuitous originationists, proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

69.
“In the second case, owing to what, with reference to what, are some honourable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists, proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously? Here, monks, some recluse or *brāhmin* is a rationalist, an investigator.

He declares his view—hammered out by reason, deduced from his investigations, following his own flight of thought—thus: ‘The self and the world originate fortuitously.’

This, monks, is the second reason, owing to which, with reference to which, some recluses and brahmins, being fortuitous originationists, proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

70.
“It is on these two grounds, monks, that those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously.

Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously, all of them do so on these two grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none…and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

71.
“It is on these eighteen grounds, monks, that those recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past and hold settled views about the past assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past

in eighteen ways.

Whatever recluses or brahmins are speculators about the past, hold settled views about the past, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past, all of them do so on these eighteen grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.

72.
“This, monks, the *Tathāgata* understands. And he understands: ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.’

He understands as well what transcends this, yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend. And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace.

Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings, their satisfaction, their unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from them, the *Tathāgata*, monks, is emancipated through non-clinging.

73.
“These are those *dharmas*, monks, that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge, propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

End of second recitation-section.

Speculators about the future

74.
“There are, monks, some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future, who hold settled views about the future, and who on forty-four grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future.

On what basis, on what grounds do they do so?

A Doctrine of Conscious Post-Mortem Survival

75.
“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality and who on sixteen grounds proclaim the self to survive percipient after death. And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, based on what, relying on what, do they propound the self as conscious after death, in sixteen ways?

76.

“The self is material ( *rūpī attā*), healthy, and conscious after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is immaterial ( *arūpī attā*), healthy, and conscious after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is both material and immaterial ( *rūpī ca arūpī ca attā*)...neither material nor immaterial ( *nevarūpī nārūpī attā*)...finite ( *antavā attā*)...infinite ( *anantavā attā*)...both finite and infinite ( *antavā ca anantavā ca attā*)...neither finite nor infinite ( *nevantavā nānantavā attā*)...of uniform perception ( *ekattasaññī attā*)...of diversified perception ( *nānattasaññī attā*)...of limited perception ( *parittasaññī attā*)...of boundless perception ( *appamāṇasaññī attā*)...exclusively happy ( *ekantasukhī attā*)...exclusively miserable ( *ekantadukkhī attā*).

The self is both happy and miserable ( *sukhadukkhī attā*).

The self is neither happy nor miserable ( *adukkhamasukhī attā*), healthy, and conscious after death,” they proclaim.

77.

"It is on these sixteen grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality proclaim the self to survive percipient after death.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins maintain a doctrine of percipient immortality, all of them do so on these sixteen grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none...about which those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of non-percipient immortality

78.

"There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of non-percipient immortality, and who on eight grounds proclaim the self to survive non-percipient after death.

And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, based on what, relying on what, do they propound the self as non-percipient after death, in eight ways?

79.

“The self is material ( *rūpī attā*), healthy, and non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is immaterial ( *arūpī attā*), healthy, and non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

“The self is both material and immaterial ( *rūpī ca arūpī ca attā*)...neither material nor immaterial ( *nevarūpī nārūpī attā*)...finite ( *antavā attā*)...infinite ( *anantavā attā*)...both finite and infinite ( *antavā ca anantavā ca attā*)...neither finite nor infinite ( *nevantavā nānantavā attā*), healthy, and non-percipient after death,” they proclaim.

80.

"It is on these eight grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of non-percipient immortality proclaim the self to survive non-percipient after death.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins maintain a doctrine of non-percipient immortality, all of them do so on these eight grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none...about which those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient immortality

81.

"There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of neither percipient nor non-percipient immortality and who on eight grounds proclaim the self to survive neither percipient nor non-percipient after death.

And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, based on what, relying on what, do they propound the self as neither percipient nor non-percipient after death, in eight ways?

82.

83.

"It is on these eight grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of neither percipient nor non-percipient immortality proclaim the self to survive neither percipient nor non-percipient after death.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins maintain a doctrine of neither percipient nor non-percipient immortality, all of them do so on these eight grounds...about which those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The doctrine of annihilation

84.

"There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are annihilationists and who on seven grounds proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.

And “Venerable recluses and brahmins, relying on what, depending on what, do you proclaim the annihilation of an existent being, its destruction and extermination, on seven grounds?”
85.

“Here, *bhikkhus*, a certain recluse or a *brāhmin* asserts the following doctrine or view: ‘When this self (*attā*), good sir, has material form, is composed of the four great elements (*cātumahābhūtika*), and originates from father and mother; since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’"
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.
86.

“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self (*attā*) as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated.
For there is, good sir, another self—divine, having material form, pertaining to the sense sphere, feeding on edible nutriment.
That you neither know nor see.
But I know it and see it.
Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’"
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.
87.

“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self (*attā*) as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated.
For there is, good sir, another self—divine, having material form, mind-made, complete in all its limbs and organs, not destitute of any faculties.
That you neither know nor see.
But I know it and see it.
Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’"
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.
88.

“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self (*attā*) as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated.
For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of infinite space, the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form, by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, by non-attention to perceptions of diversity, “Space is infinite.”
That you neither know nor see.
But I know it and see it.
Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’"
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.
89.

“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self (*attā*) as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated.
For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness, completely surmounting the base of infinite space : “Consciousness is infinite.”
That you neither know nor see.
But I know it and see it.
Since this self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, at this point the self is completely annihilated.’"
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existent being.
90.

“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self (*attā*) as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated.
For there is, good sir, another self belonging to the base of nothingness, completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness : “There is nothing.”
That you neither know nor see.
But I know it and see it.
For, good sir, it is when this self is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body, and does not exist after death, that the self is completely annihilated.
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation ( *uccheda*), destruction (*vināsa*), and extermination (*vibhava*) of an existent being.
91.
Another says to him: "Indeed, good sir, there is such a self (*ātmā*) as you say; I do not say it does not exist; but, good sir, the self (*ātmā*) is not completely annihilated (*sammā samucchinno*) at just that point."
For there is, good sir, another... There is another self which, by entirely overcoming the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatana*) and thinking, "This is peaceful, this is sublime," has attained to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception (*nevasaññānāsaññāyatana*).
You neither know it nor see it.
But I know it and see it.
That self, good sir, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death. At this point, good sir, the self is completely annihilated.
In this way, some proclaim the annihilation (*uccheda*), destruction (*vināsa*), and extermination (*vibhava*) of an existing being.
92.
"These ascetics and Brahmins who are annihilationists (*ucchedavādā*) proclaim the annihilation (*uccheda*), destruction (*vināsa*), and extermination (*vibhava*) of an existing being on seven grounds (*sattahi vatthūhi*)."
Whatever ascetics or Brahmins proclaim the annihilation (*uccheda*), destruction (*vināsa*), and extermination (*vibhava*) of an existing being, all of them do so on these seven grounds… and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.
The doctrine of *Nibbāna* here and now (*diṭṭhadhammanibbānavādo*).
93.
"There are, *bhikkhus*, some ascetics and Brahmins who are proclaimers of *Nibbāna* here and now (*diṭṭhadhammanibbānavādā*) and who, on five grounds (*pañcahi vatthūhi*), proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now (*paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ*) for an existing being."
And those venerable ascetics and Brahmins, relying on what, taking hold of what, being proclaimers of *Nibbāna* here and now (*diṭṭhadhammanibbānavādā*), proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now (*paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ*) for an existing being on five grounds (*pañcahi vatthūhi*)?
94.
"Here, *bhikkhus*, a certain ascetic or Brahmin asserts the following doctrine or view: ‘When this self, good sir, furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasures (*pañcahi kāmaguṇehi*), revels in them—at this point the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now (*paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ*)’."
In this way, some proclaim the supreme *Nibbāna* here and now (*paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ*) for an existing being.
95.
"To him, another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. I do not say that it does not exist; however, it is not at that point that the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now (*paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ*).’
What is the reason for that? Because, good sir, sense pleasures (*kāmā*) are impermanent (*aniccā*), suffering (*dukkhā*), subject to change (*vipariṇāmadhammā*), and through their change and transformation, there arise sorrow (*soka*), lamentation (*parideva*), pain (*dukkha*), grief (*domanassa*), and despair (*upāyāsā*).
But when the self, quite secluded from sense pleasures (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome states (*akusalehi dhammehi*), enters and abides in the first *jhāna*, which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*) and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ*)—at this point, good sir, This self attains the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”
In this way some proclaim the highest *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
96.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.
What is the reason for that? Because that *jhāna* contains initial thought (*vitakka*) and sustained thought (*vicāra*); therefore it is declared to be gross (*oḷārika*).
But when the self, by the subsiding of initial and sustained thought, enters and abides in the second *jhāna*, with inner tranquility and oneness of mind, which is free from initial and sustained thought and is born of concentration (*samādhija*), and accompanied by delight (*pīti*) and joy (*sukha*), that is when the self realizes the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.”
In this way some proclaim the highest *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
97.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.
What is the reason for that? It is declared to be gross because of the mental exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*) connected with rapture (*pīti*) that exists there.
But when, with the fading away of rapture (*pīti*), one abides in equanimity (*upekkhā*), mindful (*sato*) and clearly comprehending (*sampajāno*), and still experiencing happiness (*sukha*) with the body (*kāya*), enters and abides in the third *jhāna*, so that the noble ones (*ariyā*) announce: “He abides happily, in equanimity and mindfulness (*upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī*)”—at this point, good sir, the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.
In this way some proclaim the highest *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.
98.
“To him another says: ‘There is, good sir, such a self as you assert. That I do not deny. But it is not at that point that the self attains the highest *Nibbāna* here and now.
What is the reason for that? Because the mind contains the idea of joy (*sukha*), and that state is considered gross (*oḷārika*).
But when, with the abandonment of pleasure (*sukha*) and pain (*dukkha*), with the disappearance of previous joy (*somanassa*) and grief (*domanassa*), one enters and abides in a state beyond pleasure and pain in the fourth *jhāna*, which is purified by equanimity (*upekkhā*) and mindfulness (*sati*)—at this point, good sir, the self attains supreme *Nibbāna* here and now.
In this way some proclaim the highest *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being. 99.
"It is on these five grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain a doctrine of *Nibbāna* here and now proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins, monks, proclaim supreme *Nibbāna* here and now for an existent being, all of them do so on these five grounds… and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

100.
"It is on these forty-four grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future, who hold settled views about the future, assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future.

Whatever ascetics or Brahmins, monks, are speculators about the future, hold settled views about the future, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the future, all of them do so on these forty-four grounds… and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

101.
"It is on these sixty-two grounds, monks, that those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, and speculators about the past and the future together, who hold settled views about the past and the future, assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future.

102.
"Whatever ascetics or Brahmins, monks, are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, speculators about the past and the future together, who hold settled views about the past and the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future—all of them do so on these sixty-two grounds or on a certain one of them. Outside of these there is none.

103.
"This, monks, the *Tathāgata* understands: ‘These standpoints, thus assumed and thus misapprehended, lead to such a future destination, to such a state in the world beyond.’

This the *Tathāgata* knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nibbuti*).

Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings, their satisfaction, their unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from them, the *Tathāgata*, monks, is emancipated through non-clinging.

104.
"These are those *dhammas*, monks, that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise, which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge (*abhiññā*), propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

The round of agitation and vacillation.

105.
"Therein, monks, when those ascetics and Brahmins who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*) proclaim on four grounds the self (*āttānam*) and the world (*lokañca*) to be eternal (*sassataṃ*)—that is only the feeling of those who do not know and do not see; that is only the agitation and vacillation of those who are immersed in craving (*taṇhāgatānaṃ*).

The Discourse on the Revolving Stand of Views and Tenets

144.
“Here, monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who are eternalists, propounding the self and the world as eternal on four grounds; and those ascetics and Brahmins who are partly eternalists and partly non-eternalists…and those ascetics and Brahmins who are those who define the finite and the infinite… and those ascetics and Brahmins who are evasive wrigglers… and those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain fortuitous origination… and those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past… and those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain the conscious existence of beings after death… and those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain the unconscious existence of beings after death… and those ascetics and Brahmins who maintain the existence of beings after death as neither conscious nor unconscious… and those ascetics and Brahmins who are annihilationists… and those ascetics and Brahmins who advocate the attainment of *nirvāṇa* in this very life… and those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the future… and those ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, speculators about the past and the future together, who hold settled views about the past and the future, assert on sixty-two grounds various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future—all of them experience feelings by repeated contact through the six sense-bases; feeling conditions craving for them; craving conditions clinging; clinging conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, sadness, and distress. Vivaṭṭakatha and so forth.

145.
"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as they really are the arising and passing away of the six bases of contact ( *ṣaṇṇāṃ sparśāyatanānāṃ samudayañca asthaṅgamañca* ), their attraction, their peril, and the deliverance from them, then he understands what transcends all these views.

146.
"Whatever ascetics and Brahmins, bhikkhus, are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, speculators about the past and the future together, hold settled views about the past and the future, and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future—all are trapped in this net with its sixty-two divisions. Whenever they emerge, they emerge caught within this net, trapped and contained within this very net.

"Just as, bhikkhus, a skillful fisherman or a fisherman’s apprentice, after spreading a fine-meshed net over a small pool of water, might think: ‘Whatever sizeable creatures there are in this pool, all are trapped within this net, trapped and contained in this very net’—

in the same way, all those recluses and brahmins are trapped in this net with its sixty-two divisions. Whenever they emerge, they emerge caught within this net, trapped and contained within this very net.

147.
“The body of the *Tathāgata*, bhikkhus, stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut (*ucchinnabhavanettiko tathāgatassa kāyo tiṭṭhati*).

As long as his body stands, gods and men shall see him.

But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life-faculty, gods and men shall see him no more.

“Just as, bhikkhus, when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut, all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow along with it, in the same way, the body of the *Tathāgata* stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut. As long as his body stands, gods and men shall see him. But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life-faculty, gods and men shall see him no more.”

148.
When this was said, Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “It is wonderful, *Bhante*! It is marvelous, *Bhante*! What, *Bhante*, is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma (*dhammapariyāyo*)?” “Therefore, Ānanda, you should remember this discourse on the Dhamma as the ‘Net of Meaning’ (*atthajāla*), the ‘Net of the Dhamma’ (*dhammajāla*), the ‘Net of Brahmā’ (*brahmajāla*), the ‘Net of Views’ (*diṭṭhijāla*), and as ‘Unexcelled Victory in Battle’ (*anuttaro saṅgāmavijayo*)."

This is what the Blessed One said.

149.
Those *bhikkhus* were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.

And while this exposition was being spoken, the ten-thousandfold world system shook.

The *Brahmajāla Sutta* is finished, the first. 8.
"‘Having abandoned the destruction of life, the *śramaṇa* Gotama abstains from the destruction of life.

The Story of the King's Ministers

150. Thus have I heard: At one time the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha (Rajagriha), in Jīvaka Komārabhacca's Mango Grove, together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty monks.

At that time, King Ajātasattu (Ajatashatru) of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was sitting on the upper terrace of his excellent palace, surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day Uposatha, the full-moon night of the fourth month, called Komudi.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, on that Uposatha day, gave vent to this solemn utterance: “Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Tranquil is this moonlight night! Lovely is this moonlight night!

Is there any ascetic or Brahmin that we could visit tonight who might be able to bring peace to my mind?"

151. When this was said, one of the king's ministers said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Pūraṇa Kassapa, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.

May Your Majesty visit this Pūraṇa Kassapa.

Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind.”

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was silent.

152. Another minister said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Makkhali Gosāla, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.

May Your Majesty visit this Makkhali Gosāla.

Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind.”

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was silent.

153. Another minister said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Ajita Kesakambala, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.

May Your Majesty visit this Ajita Kesakambala.

Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind.”

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was silent.

154. Another minister said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Pakudha Kaccāyana, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.

May Your Majesty visit this Pakudha Kaccāyana.

Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind.”

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was silent.

155. Another minister said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.

May Your Majesty visit this Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta.

Perhaps he might bring peace to your mind.”

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi, was silent.

156. Another minister said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Vedehi: "Sire, there is Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable.
...Nātaputta (pī.)...
He is a leader of a group ( *saṅghī*), a teacher (*gaṇī*), an instructor of a group (*gaṇācariyo*), well-known (*ñātaḥ*), famous (*yasassī*), a founder of a sect (*titthakaro*), highly respected (*sādhusammato*), known to many (*bahujanassa*), experienced (*rattaññū*), long an ascetic (*cirapabbajito*), aged (*addhagato*), advanced in years (*vayoanuppatto*).
May Your Majesty visit the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
Perhaps, indeed, Your Majesty... 'Perhaps by visiting the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, he might bring peace to your mind.'
When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, was silent.
The Story of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.
157.
At that time, Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Why are you silent, friend Jīvaka?"
"This Blessed One, the worthy and perfectly enlightened one, is staying in our mango grove with a large community of monks, with thirteen hundred monks.
That Blessed One, Gotama, has a good reputation that has spread, namely: 'Indeed, that Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed, trainer of those who can be trained, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'
May Your Majesty visit that Blessed One.
Perhaps by visiting the Blessed One, he might bring peace to your mind."
158.
"Then, friend Jīvaka, have the elephant vehicles prepared."
"Yes, Your Majesty," said Jīvaka Komārabhacca, and having promised King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, he had five hundred female elephants prepared, and also the royal elephant for the king. Then he reported to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen: "The elephant vehicles are ready for you, Your Majesty. Now is the time to do what you think fit."
159.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, had each of his women mount one of the five hundred female elephants, and he himself mounted the royal elephant. With torches being carried, he set out from Rājagaha with great royal majesty, going to the mango grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.
Then, when King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, was not far from the mango grove, fear arose in him, there was trembling, and there was horror.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, frightened and agitated, his hair standing on end, said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Are you not deceiving me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not betraying me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not handing me over to my enemies? How can it be that in such a large community of monks, of thirteen hundred monks, there is neither the sound of clearing the throat, nor the sound of coughing, nor any noise?"
"Do not be afraid, great king, do not be afraid, great king.
I am not deceiving you, Your Majesty, I am not betraying you, Your Majesty, I am not handing you over to your enemies.
Approach, great king, approach, great king. These lamps are burning in the round pavilion."
The Questions about the Fruits of Asceticism.
160.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, went as far as the ground was suitable for elephants, and then dismounting from the elephant, he approached the door of the round pavilion on foot. Having approached, he said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Where, friend Jīvaka, is the Blessed One?"
"Here, great king, is the Blessed One. Here, great king, is the Blessed One, seated facing east, leaning against the middle pillar, surrounded by the community of monks."
161.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, approached the Blessed One, and having approached, he stood to one side.
Standing to one side, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, having surveyed the community of monks, silent, utterly silent, like a clear lake, exclaimed in joy: "May my son, Udayabhadda, be endowed with the same peace as this community of monks is now endowed with."
"Do your thoughts go to the one you love, great king?"
"Prince Udayabhadda is dear to me, venerable sir.
May my son, Udayabhadda, be endowed with the same peace as this community of monks is now endowed with."
162.
Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, having bowed down to the Blessed One, and saluted the community of monks with joined hands, sat down to one side. King Ajātasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, of Magadha, sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain point, if the Blessed One would grant me an opportunity to answer my question.”

“Ask, great king, whatever you wish.”

163. “Venerable sir, just as there are these various crafts, such as elephant trainers (*hatthārohā*), horse trainers (*assārohā*), charioteers (*rathikā*), archers (*dhanuggahā*), standard bearers (*celakā*), camp marshals (*calakā*), those who provide alms (*piṇḍadāyakā*), commandos (*uggā*), high royal officers (*rājaputtā*), front-line soldiers (*pakkhandino*), bull-warriors (*mahānāgā*), heroes (*sūrā*), mail-clad warriors (*cammayodhino*), domestic slaves (*dāsikaputtā*), confectioners (*āḷārikā*), barbers (*kappakā*), bath attendants (*nhāpakā*), cooks (*sūdā*), garland-makers (*mālākārā*), laundrymen (*rajakā*), weavers (*pesakārā*), basket-makers (*naḷakārā*), potters (*kumbhakārā*), statisticians (*gaṇakā*), accountants (*muddikā*), and whatever other various crafts of a similar nature there are. All those enjoy here and now the visible fruit of their craft ( *sandiṭṭhikaṃ sippaphalaṃ*). They make themselves happy and content with it. They properly establish an uplifting offering, conducive to heavenly reward, and leading to heaven. Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any fruit of the ascetic life (*sāmaññaphalaṃ*) that is similarly visible here and now?”

164. “Do you remember, great king, ever asking other ascetics and Brahmins this question?” "I do remember asking them, venerable sir." "If it is not troublesome for you, great king, please tell us how they answered." "It is not troublesome for me, venerable sir, when the Blessed One, or one like the Blessed One, is present." "Then speak, great king."

The Discourse on Pūraṇa Kassapa

165. "One time, venerable sir, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa, and after approaching, I exchanged courteous greetings with Pūraṇa Kassapa. After exchanging polite conversation and courteous greetings, I sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, venerable sir, I said to Pūraṇa Kassapa: 'Good Kassapa, just as there are these various crafts, such as elephant trainers (*hatthārohā*), horse trainers (*assārohā*), charioteers (*rathikā*)..." Archers (*dhanuggahā*), standard bearers (*celakā*), camp marshals (*calakā*), army caterers (*piṇḍadāyakā*), champions (*uggā*) and senior royal officers (*rājaputtā*), scouts (*pakkhandino*), bull-warriors (*mahānāgā*), heroes (*sūrā*), mail-clad warriors (*cammayodhino*), domestic slaves’ sons (*dāsikaputtā*), confectioners (*āḷārikā*), barbers (*kappakā*), bath attendants (*nhāpakā*), cooks (*sūdā*), garland-makers (*mālākārā*), laundrymen (*rajakā*), weavers (*pesakārā*), basket-makers (*naḷakārā*), potters (*kumbhakārā*), statisticians (*gaṇakā*), accountants (*muddikā*)—and whatever other skills there are: they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sippaphalaṃ*), they themselves are delighted and gratified, their mothers and fathers are delighted and gratified, their children and wives are delighted and gratified, their friends and colleagues are delighted and gratified, and they set up an offering of the best kind for ascetics and Brahmins, conducive to heaven, resulting in happiness, and leading to the celestial realms.

Can you, Venerable Kassapa, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*)?”

166. “When this had been said, venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa said this to me: ‘Great king, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief and weariness, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies, no evil (*pāpaṃ*) is done.

If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass of flesh (*maṃsakhalaṃ*) and one single heap of flesh (*maṃsapuñjaṃ*), there would be no evil (*pāpaṃ*) as a result of that, no evil (*pāpassa āgamo*) would accrue.

If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, slaying, cutting or causing to be cut, burning or causing to be burnt, there would be no evil (*pāpaṃ*) as a result of that, no evil (*pāpassa āgamo*) would accrue.

If one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given, sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed, there would be no merit (*puññaṃ*) as a result of that, no merit (*puññassa āgamo*) would accrue.

In giving (*dānena*), self-control (*damena*), restraint (*saṃyamena*) and truthful speech (*saccavajjena*), there is no merit (*puññaṃ*), and no merit (*puññassa āgamo*) accrues.’

Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (*akiriyaṃ*).

“Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*) he explained to me the inefficacy of action (*akiriyaṃ*).

Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse (*samaṇaṃ*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇaṃ*) living in his realm.’

So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa nor did I reject it.

Without rejoicing Without rejecting it, feeling displeased, not expressing my displeasure in words, accepting those very words, without overturning them, I got up from my seat and left.

The doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla:

167. “Once, venerable sir, I approached Makkhali Gosāla, and after approaching Makkhali Gosāla, I exchanged greetings with him. Having exchanged courteous and amiable greetings, I sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Makkhali Gosāla: ‘As these various arts and crafts…pe… is it possible, friend Gosāla, to explain here and now a fruit of the ascetic life that is visible in this very life?’”

168. “When this was said, venerable sir, Makkhali Gosāla said this to me: ‘There is no cause, great king, no condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no cause, no condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition. There is no self-power, no other-power, there is no human power, no strength, no energy, no human stamina, no human might. All beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are powerless, without strength, without energy, transformed by fate, circumstance, and nature; they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth. There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin, sixty hundred, and six hundred; five hundred kinds of action, five kinds of action, three kinds of action, full action and half action, sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate aeons, six classes, eight stages of human existence, forty-nine hundred Ājīvika livelihoods, forty-nine hundred wanderers, forty-nine hundred Nāga abodes, twenty hundred faculties, thirty hundred hells, thirty-six realms of dust, seven conscious wombs, seven unconscious wombs, seven Nigaṇṭha wombs, seven gods, seven humans, seven goblins, seven lakes, seven whirlpools, seven hundred whirlpools, seven precipices, seven hundred precipices, seven dreams, seven hundred dreams, eighty-four hundred thousand great aeons in which both fools and wise, running and wandering through transmigration, will make an end to suffering.’"

There... There is no such thing as saying: "By this virtue, practice, austerity, or holy life, I will ripen unripened action ( *karma*), or I will gradually eliminate ripened action as it comes up."

Pleasure and pain are meted out, the round of rebirths ( *saṃsāra*) is limited, there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it.

Just as a ball of string, when thrown, unwinds as it rolls along, so too, by wandering through the cycle of rebirths, both fools and wise will make an end to suffering.

169.

"Thus, venerable sir ( *bhante*), when asked about the visible fruit of recluseship ( *sāmaññaphala*), Makkhali Gosāla explained purification through wandering in *saṃsāra*.

Venerable sir ( *bhante*), just as if one asked about a mango and someone would speak about a breadfruit, or if one asked about a breadfruit and someone would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about a visible fruit of recluseship ( *sāmaññaphala*), he explained purification through wandering in *saṃsāra*.

Then, venerable sir ( *bhante*), I thought to myself: 'One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse ( *samaṇa*) or Brahmin ( *brāhmaṇa*) living in his realm.'

So, venerable sir ( *bhante*), I neither rejoiced in Makkhali Gosala’s words nor did I reject them.

Without accepting his doctrine, without rejecting it, feeling dissatisfied and without expressing my dissatisfaction, but carefully considering his words without embracing them, I got up from my seat and left.

The teaching of Ajita Kesakambala

170.

"Another time, venerable sir ( *bhante*), I approached Ajita Kesakambala, and after exchanging courteous greetings with Ajita Kesakambala, I sat down.

Having concluded our polite and amiable conversation, I sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, venerable sir ( *bhante*), I said to Ajita Kesakambala: 'Just as there are these various skilled crafts… and so on … is it possible, venerable Ajita, to explain in the same way a visible fruit of recluseship ( *sāmaññaphala*) in this very life?'

171.

"When this was said, venerable sir ( *bhante*), Ajita Kesakambala said to me: 'Great king ( *mahārāja*), there is no giving, no offering, no sacrifice; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions ( *karma*); there is no this world [or the next (in some versions)], there is no other world, there is no mother, no father, no beings who are reborn spontaneously; in the world there are no recluses (*samaṇa*) or Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*) who have attained right practice [or who have attained (in some versions)], who fare rightly, who having realized this world and the next for themselves he declared, after gaining deep knowledge for himself.
This human being is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space.
Four men carry the corpse along on a bier.
their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground. (yāvāḷāhanā padāni paññāyanti)
His bones turn pigeon-colored. His meritorious offerings end in ashes.
Giving is a doctrine of fools. (dattupaññattaṃ yadidaṃ dānaṃ)
When anyone asserts doctrine that there is giving and the like, it is empty, false prattle.
Fools and wise, at the breaking-up of the body, are destroyed and perish, they do not exist after death.”
172.
“Thus, Lord, Ajita Kesakamball, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the doctrine of annihilation to me.
Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me annihilation.
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or *brāhmaṇa* dwelling in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Ajita Kesakambala nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.
Pakudha Kaccāyana's doctrine.
173.
“Another time, venerable sir, I approached Pakudha Kaccáyana, and after exchanging greetings with Pakudha Kaccāyana, I sat down.
Having ex-changed courtesies, I sat down to one side
I then asked him if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now.
174.
’When I had finished speaking, Pakudha Kaccáyana said to me: “Your Majesty, these seven bodies are unmade, unfashioned, uncreated, without a creator, barren, Immovable as a pillar.
They do not shake, they do not change, they do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain.
Which are the seven? The earth-body (*pṛthivīkāya*), the water-body (*āpokāya*), the fire-body (*tejokāya*), the air-body (*vāyokāya*), pleasure (*sukhe*), pain (*duḥkhe*), and the soul (*jīve*) as the seventh – these seven bodies are unmade, not made by anything, uncreated, not created, barren, immovable as a pillar.
They do not shake, they do not change, they do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain.
Herein, there is no killer nor one who causes killing; no hearer nor one who causes hearing; no cognizer nor one who causes cognition.
Even if someone were to cut off a head with a sharp sword, no one deprives anyone of life; the sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies.
175.
"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me in a completely irrelevant way.
Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me in a completely irrelevant way.
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a *śramaṇa* or *brāhmaṇa* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana nor did I reject it. But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.
The doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
176.
"Another time, venerable sir, I approached Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, and after approaching, I exchanged greetings with Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
Having exchanged courteous talk that encourages friendliness, I sat down to one side.
Having sat down to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta: ‘Just as these various crafts are…pe… is it possible, venerable Aggivessana, to describe in the same way a visible fruit of recluseship in this very life?’ 177.
"When this was said, venerable sir, the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said this to me: 'Here, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained by a fourfold restraint (*cātuyāmasaṃvarasaṃvuto*).

And how, great king, is a Nigaṇṭha restrained by a fourfold restraint? Here, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with regard to all water (*sabbavārivārito*), he is endowed with the avoidance of all evil (*sabbavāriyutto*); he is cleansed by the avoidance of all evil (*sabbavāridhuto*); and he is suffused with the avoidance of all evil (*sabbavāriphuṭo*).

In this way, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained by a fourfold restraint (*cātuyāmasaṃvarasaṃvuto*).

Because, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is thus restrained by a fourfold restraint (*cātuyāmasaṃvarasaṃvuto*), he is called, great king, a Nigaṇṭha who is self-perfected (*gatatto*), self-controlled (*yatatto*), and self-established (*ṭhitatto*)."

178.
"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*), he explained the fourfold restraint (*cātuyāmasaṃvaraṃ*) to me.

Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*), he explained the fourfold restraint (*cātuyāmasaṃvaraṃ*) to me.

Then, venerable sir, this thought occurred to me: 'How could one like me think of troubling an ascetic or a Brahmin dwelling in my realm?'

So I, venerable sir, neither rejoiced in the statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, nor did I reject it.

Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, being displeased, without expressing displeasure, keeping that very statement in mind, without overturning it, I got up from my seat and departed.

The Doctrine of Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta

179.
"Once, venerable sir, I approached Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta; having approached, I exchanged greetings with Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta.

Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, I sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta: 'Just as there are these various fields of skill…pe… is it possible, venerable Sañcaya, to explain a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*) in the very Dhamma that is seen?'

180.
"When this was said, venerable sir, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta said this to me: 'If you ask me, "Is there another world (*paro loko*)?" if I thought that there is another world (*paro loko*), I would declare to you that "There is another world (*paro loko*)."

I don’t think so. I don’t say it is so, and I don’t say otherwise. I don’t say it is not. But I do not say “It is this way,” nor do I say “It is not not so.”
If you ask: ‘Isn’t there another world? ‘. . . ‘Both? ‘. . . ‘Neither? ‘. . . ‘Are there beings who have taken rebirth spontaneously? ‘ ‘Aren’t there? ‘. . . ‘Both? ‘. . . ‘Neither? ‘ . . . ‘Is there fruit and result of good and bad deeds? ‘ ‘Isn’t there? ‘. . . ‘Both? ‘. . . ‘Neither? ‘ . . . ‘Does the *Tathāgata* exist after death? Does he not exist after death? Does he both exist and not exist after death? Does he neither exist nor not exist after death?’ If you ask me this, I would answer that the *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death.
But I do not say “It is this way,” nor “It is that way,” nor “It is otherwise.” I do not say “It is not so,” nor do I say “It is not not so.”

181. “Thus, venerable sir, when asked about the visible fruit of recluseship, Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered me evasively.
Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me evasively.
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘Of all these ascetics and Brahmins, this Sañjaya is the most stupid and confused.
How could someone, when asked about a visible fruit of recluseship, answer evasively?’
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a *śramaṇa* or *brāhmaṇa* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Sañjaya Belatthaputta nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without rejecting it, feeling dissatisfied, without uttering a word of dissatisfaction, I got up from my seat and left.
The first visible fruit of recluseship.

182. “So, venerable sir, I ask the Blessed One (*Bhagavant*), too: ‘Just as there are these various crafts, such as elephant trainers, horse trainers, charioteers, Middle morality.
11.
“Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food given in faith, remain addicted to damaging seed and plant life, that is to say, plants propagated from roots (*mūlabījaṃ*), stems (*khandhabījaṃ*), joints (*phaḷubījaṃ*), cuttings (*aggabījaṃ*), and seeds (*bījabījameva pañcamaṃ*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from damaging seed and plant life.” Thus the ordinary person, monks, speaking in praise of the Tathāgata, might speak.
12.
“Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food given in faith, remain addicted to enjoying stored-up goods, that is to say, stored-up food (*annasannidhiṃ*), drinks (*pānasannidhiṃ*), garments (*vatthasannidhiṃ*), vehicles (*yānasannidhiṃ*), bedding (*sayanasannidhiṃ*), scents (*gandhasannidhiṃ*), and comestibles (*āmisasannidhiṃ*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from such enjoyment.” Thus the ordinary person, monks, speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak.
13.
“Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food given in faith, remain addicted to attending unsuitable shows, that is to say, dancing (*naccaṃ*), singing (*gītaṃ*), instrumental music (*vāditaṃ*), theatrical performances (*pekkhaṃ*), narrations of legends (*akkhānaṃ*), music played by hand-clapping (*pāṇissaraṃ*), cymbals and drums (*vetāḷaṃ*), picture houses (*kumbhathūṇaṃ*), acrobatic performances (*sobhanakaṃ*), the *caṇḍālaṃ*, *vaṃsaṃ*, *dhovanaṃ*, combats of elephants (*hatthiyuddhaṃ*), horses (*assayuddhaṃ*), buffaloes (*mahiṃsayuddhaṃ*), bulls (*usabhayuddhaṃ*), goats (*ajayuddhaṃ*), rams (*meṇḍayuddhaṃ*), cocks (*kukkuṭayuddhaṃ*) and quails (*vaṭṭakayuddhaṃ*), stick-fights (*daṇḍayuddhaṃ*), boxing (*muṭṭhiyuddhaṃ*) and wrestling (*nibbuddhaṃ*), *uyyodhikaṃ*, *balaggaṃ*, battle-arrays (*senābyūhaṃ*), and reviews of the army (*anīkadassanaṃ*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from attending such displays.” Thus the ordinary person, monks, speaking in praise of the Tathāgata, might speak.
14.
“Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food given in faith, remain addicted to such games that are a basis for negligence, that is to say, *aṭṭhapadaṃ*, *dasapadaṃ*, *ākāsaṃ*, *parihārapathaṃ*, *santikaṃ*, *khalikaṃ*, *ghaṭikaṃ*, *salākahatthaṃ*, *akkhaṃ*, *paṅgacīraṃ*, *vaṅkakaṃ*, *mokkhacikaṃ*, *ciṅgulikaṃ*, *pattāḷhakaṃ*, *rathakaṃ*, *dhanukaṃ*, *akkharikaṃ*, *manesikaṃ*, *yathāvajjaṃ*... Archers, Celakas, Calakas, almsgivers, Uggas, princes, shock troops, bull-warriors, heroes, mail-clad warriors, sons of slave women, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and whatever other various crafts there are, they live enjoying here and now the visible fruit of their craft. They please and gratify themselves with it. They please and gratify their mothers and fathers, they please and gratify their children and wives, they please and gratify their friends and colleagues, they establish a high offering to ascetics and Brahmins, conducive to heaven, with happy result and leading to heaven.

Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any fruit of the monastic life that is similarly visible here and now?”

183. "It is possible, great king.

Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Suppose you have a man, a slave, a workman, rising up before you, retiring after you, doing whatever you want, acting always for your pleasure, speaking politely to you, and is ever on the lookout to see that you are satisfied.

He might think: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvelous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds! This King of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of Vedehi, is a man, and I too am a man. This King of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of Vedehi, lives replete with the five strands of sense pleasures, I deem him to be like a god. But I am his slave, his workman— rising before him, retiring after him, doing whatever he wants,acting always for his pleasure, speaking politely to him, ever on the lookout to see that he is satisfied. I ought to do something meritorious. What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

After some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness. Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. And if people were to tell you this: ‘Your Majesty should know, that man of yours— the slave, the workman, rising up before you, retiring after you, doing whatever you want, acting always for your pleasure, speaking politely to you, and ever on the lookout to see that you are satisfied— he has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the saffron robes, and gone forth from home to homelessness.’ Having gone forth, he dwells restrained in body (kāyena saṃvuto), speech (vācāya saṃvuto), and mind (manasā saṃvuto), content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.

Would you say: ‘Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become my slave, my workman, rising before me, retiring after me, doing whatever I want, acting always for my pleasure, speaking politely to me, ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied’?”

184. "Certainly not, venerable sir."

Then rather, we would pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes (cīvara), almsfood (piṇḍapāta), dwelling (senāsana), and medicinal requirements (gilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārehi). And we would provide him with righteous protection, defense, and security."

185. "What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ)?" "Assuredly, venerable sir, if such is the case, there is a visible fruit of recluseship (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ)."

"This, great king, is the first fruit of recluseship (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), visible here and now (diṭṭheva dhamme), that I point out to you."

The second visible fruit of recluseship (dutiyasandiṭṭhikasāmaññaphalaṃ).

186. "Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out some other fruit of recluseship (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ) visible here and now (diṭṭheva dhamme)?" "It is possible, great king.

"Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.

Answer as you see fit.

What do you think, great king? Suppose there is a farmer (kassako), a householder (gahapatiko), who pays taxes (karakārako) to maintain the royal revenue, one who increases his store (rāsivaḍḍhako).

He might think: “It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny (gati) and fruits (vipāko) of meritorious deeds (puññānaṃ)!

This King Ajātasattu, son of the Videhi princess, is a man, and I too am a man.

This King Ajātasattu, son of the Videhi princess, enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure, as if he were a god, I think.

Whereas I am a farmer, a householder, who pays taxes to maintain the royal revenue, one who increases his store.

I ought to do meritorious deeds (puññāni kareyyaṃ).

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard (kesamassuṃ ohāretvā), put on the ochre robes (kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā), and go forth from the household life into homelessness (agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya)’nti.

"After some time, he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small, abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard (kesamassuṃ ohāretvā), puts on saffron robes (kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā, He should go forth from the household life into homelessness.

Having thus gone forth, he dwells restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the bare necessities of food and clothing, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: "Sire, you should know that so-and-so, that man of yours who was a farmer, a householder, a tax-payer, a revenue-increaser, has now shaved off his hair and beard, put on the saffron robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness."

Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the bare necessities of food and clothing, delighting in solitude.

Would you then say: "Let that man come back to me, men. Let him again become a farmer, a householder, a tax-payer, a revenue-increaser?"

187.

"No, venerable sir."

"Rather, we would pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes, almsfood, dwelling, and medicinal requirements. And we would provide him with righteous protection, defense, and security."

188.

"What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship?" "Assuredly, venerable sir, if such is the case, there is a visible fruit of recluseship."

"This, great king, is the second fruit of recluseship, visible here and now, that I point out to you."

A More Excellent Fruit of Recluseship

189.

"Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any other fruit of recluseship visible here and now, more excellent and sublime than these two fruits?" "It is possible, great king.

Then listen, great king, and attend carefully, I will speak."

"Yes, venerable sir," King Ajātasattu, son of Vedehi, replied to the Blessed One.

190.

The Blessed One said this: "Here, great king, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arahant*, a fully enlightened *Buddha*, endowed with wisdom and conduct, a *Sugata*, a knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.

He makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its *devas*, *Māras*, & *Brahmās*, its generations with their contemplatives & brahmans, their rulers & commonfolk;

He teaches the *Dhamma* admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; he expounds the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.

191.

"A householder or a householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that *Dhamma*.

Having heard this *Dhamma*, he gains faith in the *Tathāgata*.

Possessing that faith, he considers thus: 'Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open.

It is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.

What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

192.

"After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness.

193.

"And having gone forth, he dwells restrained by the restraint of the *Pātimokkha*, possessed of proper behavior and resort. Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he is possessed of moral discipline. He guards the doors of his sense faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is content.

The Lesser Morality

194.

"And how, great king, is a *bhikkhu* perfected in morality? Here, great king, having abandoned the destruction of life, the *bhikkhu* abstains from the destruction of life.

Since, if he left the eye faculty (*cakkhundriyaṃ*) unrestrained (*asaṃvutaṃ*), bad, unwholesome states of longing (*abhijjhā*) and dejection (*domanassā*) might invade him, he practices the way of its restraint (*saṃvarāya*), he guards the eye faculty (*cakkhundriyaṃ*), he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty (*cakkhundriye saṃvaram āpajjati*).

Contentment (*santoso*)

Wherever he goes he sets out taking only along with him.

After returning from his almsround, following his meals, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and sets up mindfulness before him.
217.
"Abandoning hankering (*abhijjhaṃ*) for the world (*loke*), he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering, and he purifies his mind from it.
Abandoning ill-will and hatred (*byāpādapadosaṃ*) Abiding with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings, he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred.
Having abandoned sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor.
Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse.
Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.

218. "Just as, great king, a man might take a loan and apply it to his business, and his business were to succeed, so that he could pay back his old debts (iṇamūlāni) and would have enough money left over to maintain a wife. He might think: 'Before this I developed my business by borrowing. Now my businesses have prospered. So I have paid back all the money from the old loans, and I have extra left over to maintain a wife.' And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy (pāmojjaṃ, somanassaṃ).

219. "Just as, great king, a man were to become sick, afflicted, gravely ill, so that he could not enjoy his food and his strength would decline. After some time he would recover from that illness and would enjoy his food and regain his bodily strength. He might think: 'Before this I was ill, afflicted, gravely ill, so that I could not enjoy my food and my body had no strength. Now I have recovered from that illness, I enjoy my food, and my body has strength.' And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy (pāmojjaṃ, somanassaṃ).

220. "Just as, great king, a man were locked up in a prison. After some time he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss of his possessions. He might think: 'Before this I was imprisoned. Now I am released from that prison, safe and secure, and there is no loss to my possessions.' And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy (pāmojjaṃ, somanassaṃ).

221. "Just as, great king, a man were a slave, without independence, subservient to others, unable to go where he wants. After some time he would be released from slavery and gain his independence; he would no longer be subservient to others but a free man able to go where he wants. He might think: 'Before this I was a slave, without independence, subservient to others, unable to go where I wanted. Now I am released from that slavery, I am independent, not subservient to others, a free man able to go where I want.' And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy (pāmojjaṃ, somanassaṃ).

222. "Just as, great king, a man with wealth and possessions were travelling along a desert road where food was scarce and dangers were many. After some time he would cross over the desert and arrive safely at a village which is safe and free from danger.
He might think: "Before this, I was wealthy and prosperous, but I embarked on a dangerous and frightening desert road, a time of famine.
Now I have safely crossed that desert, reached the edge of a village, a safe and fearless place."
Then, as a result of that, he would gain joy (*pāmojjaṃ*) and attain gladness (*somanassaṃ*).

223.
"In the same way, great king (*mahārāja*), when a *bhikkhu* sees that these five hindrances (*pañca nīvaraṇe*) are unabandoned within himself, he regards that as a debt (*iṇaṃ*), as a sickness (*rogaṃ*), as confinement in prison (*bandhanāgāraṃ*), as slavery (*dāsabyaṃ*), as a desert road (*kantāraddhānamaggaṃ*).

224.
"But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt (*āṇaṇyaṃ*), as good health (*ārogyaṃ*), as release from prison (*bandhanāmokkhaṃ*), as freedom from slavery (*bhujissaṃ*), as a place of safety (*khemantabhūmiṃ*).

225.
"When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness (*pāmojjaṃ*) arises. When he is gladdened, rapture (*pīti*) arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he experiences happiness (*sukhaṃ*); being happy, his mind becomes concentrated (*samādhiyati*).

He Thus, or in this way, the ordinary person, when describing the virtues of the *Tathāgata*, might say: ‘The recluse Gotama is abstinent from such indulgence in games and the grounds for negligence.’

15. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some honorable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food offered in faith, remain addicted to the use of high and luxurious beds and seats, such as: a couch, a throne, a long-haired coverlet, a variegated coverlet, a white woollen coverlet, a coverlet embroidered with flowers, a quilt stuffed with cotton, a coverlet embroidered with animal figures, a woollen coverlet with hair on both sides, a woollen coverlet with hair on one side, a silk coverlet, a rug, an elephant-covering, a horse-covering, a chariot-covering, a spread of antelope skin, a choice spread of antelope-hide, a canopy with an awning, or a couch with red cushions at both ends; the *samaṇa* Gotama refrains from such high and luxurious beds.’ Thus, or in this way, the ordinary person, when describing the virtues of the *Tathāgata*, might speak.

16. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some honorable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food offered in faith, remain addicted to such practices that involve self-adornment and embellishment, such as rubbing scented powder into the body, massaging with oils, bathing in perfumed water, kneading the limbs, using mirrors, ointments, garlands, perfumes, unguents, face-powder, make-up, bracelets, headbands, decorated walking sticks, ornamented medicine tubes, swords, sunshades, embroidered sandals, turbans, jewels, yak tail whisks and long-fringed white robes; the *samaṇa* Gotama refrains from such practices that involve self-adornment and embellishment.’ Thus, or in this way, the ordinary person, when describing the virtues of the *Tathāgata*, might speak.

17. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some honorable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food offered in faith, remain addicted to the following types of frivolous talk (*tiracchānakathaṃ*), such as talk about kings, talk about thieves, talk about ministers, talk about armies, talk about dangers, talk about battles, talk about food, talk about drinks, talk about clothes, talk about beds, talk about garlands, talk about perfumes, talk about relatives, talk about vehicles, talk about villages, talk about towns, talk about cities, talk about countries, talk about women, talk about heroes, street gossip, gossip at the well, stories of those long dead, diverse talk, accounts of the world, accounts of the sea, talk about existence and non-existence, the *samaṇa* Gotama refrains from such frivolous talk.’ Thus, or in this way, the ordinary person, when describing the virtues of the *Tathāgata*, might speak. He suffuses, drenches, fills, and permeates this very body with delight and joy born of detachment ( *vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body untouched by this delight and joy born of detachment.

227.

"Just as, great king, a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice, having sprinkled soap powder in a metal basin, gradually mixes it with water, so that the ball of soap powder becomes permeated with moisture, encompassed by moisture, suffused with moisture inside and out, yet does not trickle; even so, great king, a *bhikkhu* suffuses, drenches, fills, and permeates this very body with delight and joy born of detachment ( *vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body untouched by this delight and joy born of detachment.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life ( *sāmaññaphala*), more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

The Second *Jhāna*.

228.

"Furthermore, great king, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought (*vitakka-vicārānaṃ vūpasamā*), a *bhikkhu*, by gaining inner tranquility and oneness of mind (*ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ*), enters and remains in the second *jhāna*, which is without applied and sustained thought, born of concentration (*samādhijaṃ*), filled with delight and joy.

He suffuses, drenches, fills, and permeates this very body with delight and joy born of concentration (*samādhijena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body untouched by this delight and joy born of concentration.

229.

"Just as, great king, there were a deep lake whose waters welled up from below, having no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be refilled from time to time with showers of rain;

But from that very lake, cool streams of water would well up and drench, steep, fill, and permeate that very lake with cool water, so that there would be no part of that entire lake untouched by the cool water.

Even so, great king, a *bhikkhu* suffuses, drenches, fills, and permeates this very body with delight and joy born of concentration (*samādhijena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body untouched by this delight and joy born of concentration.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sāmaññaphala*), more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

The Third *Jhāna*.

230.

"Furthermore, great king, with the fading away of rapture (*pītiyā ca virāgā*), a *bhikkhu* dwells in equanimity (*upekkhako*), mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body; thus he enters and dwells in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare: 'He dwells happily with equanimity and mindfulness.'

He suffuses, drenches, fills, and permeates this very body with happiness free from rapture (*nippītikena sukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body untouched by this happiness.

231.

"Just as, great king, suppose in a lotus pond there were blue lotuses ( *uppalāni*), white lotuses ( *padumāni*), or red lotuses (*puṇḍarīkāni*) that have been born in the water, grow in the water, and never rise up above the water, but flourish immersed in the water. From their tips to their roots they would be drenched, steeped, saturated, and suffused with cool water, so that there would be no part of those lotuses not suffused with cool water.

In the same way, great king, the *bhikkhu* drenches, steeps, saturates and suffuses his body with the happiness free from rapture (*nippītikena sukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

The Fourth *Jhāna*.

232.

"Furthermore, great king, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and grief, the *bhikkhu* enters and dwells in the fourth *jhāna*, which is neither pleasant nor painful and contains mindfulness fully purified by equanimity. He sits suffusing his body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by a pure bright mind. 233.

"Just as, great king, a man might sit covered from head to foot with a white cloth, so that no part of his entire body would be untouched by the white cloth; even so, great king, the *bhikkhu* sits pervading this very body with a mind that is utterly pure and bright, so that no part of his entire body is unpervaded by a mind that is utterly pure and bright.

This, too, great king, is a fruit of the monastic life visible in this very life, more surpassing and sublime than the previous fruits of the monastic life visible in this very life.

Insight knowledge (*vipassanāñāṇaṃ*).

234.

"Again, with the mind thus concentrated, purified, bright, spotless, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, steadfast, and having attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision.

He understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, nourished on rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration; and this consciousness of mine is dependent on it and bound up with it.’

235.

"Just as, great king, there might be a *maṇi* jewel, a beryl, of fine water, eight-faceted, well-cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all good qualities;

and in it a thread might be strung, blue or yellow or red or white or brown.

A man with good sight, taking it in his hand, might review it thus: ‘This is a *maṇi* jewel, a beryl, of fine water, eight-faceted, well-cut, clear, limpid, flawless, endowed with all good qualities; and in it is strung this thread, blue or yellow or red or white or brown.’

Even so, great king, the *bhikkhu* with mind thus concentrated, purified, bright, spotless, rid of defilements, pliable, workable, steadfast, and having attained imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision.

He understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, nourished on rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration; and this consciousness of mine is dependent on it and bound up with it.’

This, too, great king, is a fruit of the monastic life visible in this very life, more surpassing and sublime than the previous fruits of the monastic life visible in this very life. The knowledge of the mind-made psychic power.

236. "When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. He creates from this body another body having material form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not lacking any faculties.

237. "Great king, suppose a man were to draw out a reed from its sheath. He would think: 'This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or suppose a man were to draw a sword out from its scabbard. He would think: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or suppose a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. He would think: 'This is the snake; this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.’

In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. He creates from this body another body having material form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not lacking any faculties. This, great king, is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

The knowledge of the modes of supernormal power.

238. "When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power. He experiences the manifold supernormal powers: Being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land. By means of the earth.
Sitting cross-legged, he travels through space like a winged bird.
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful.
He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.

"Just as, great king, a skilled potter or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared clay whatever kind of vessel he might desire.
Or suppose, great king, a skilled ivory-worker or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared ivory whatever kind of ivory work he might desire.
Or suppose, great king, a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared gold whatever kind of gold work he might desire.
In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power.
He experiences the various modes of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space.
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water.
He walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land.
Sitting cross-legged, he travels through space like a winged bird.
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful.
He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.
This, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.
Knowledge of the divine ear.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element.
With the divine ear-element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sound, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near. 241. “Just as, great king, a man traveling along a highway, might hear the sound of a *bheri* drum, a *mṛdīṅga* drum, a conch, a *paṇava* cymbal, or a *dindima* kettle-drum. It might occur to him, ‘That is the sound of a *bheri* drum,’ ‘That is the sound of a *mṛdīṅga* drum,’ ‘That is the sound of a conch, a *paṇava* cymbal, or a *dindima* kettle-drum.’ In the same way, great king, when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, malleable, ready to act, firm, and unshakeable, he directs and inclines his mind to the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*). With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, divine and human, those that are far and near. This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the monastic life more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. Knowledge of others' minds (*cetopariyañāṇaṃ*).

242. "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, malleable, ready to act, firm, and unshakeable, he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge of others' minds (*cetopariyañāṇāya*). He knows and understands the minds of other beings and individuals, having encompassed them with his own mind: He understands a mind with passion (*sarāgaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind with passion’ (*sarāgaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a mind without passion (*vītarāgaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind without passion’ (*vītarāgaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a mind with aversion (*sadosaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind with aversion’ (*sadosaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a mind without aversion (*vītadosaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind without aversion’ (*vītadosaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a mind with delusion (*samohaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind with delusion’ (*samohaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a mind without delusion (*vītamohaṃ citta*) as ‘a mind without delusion’ (*vītamohaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a constricted mind (*saṅkhittaṃ citta*) as ‘a constricted mind’ (*saṅkhittaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a scattered mind (*vikkhittaṃ citta*) as ‘a scattered mind’ (*vikkhittaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a developed mind (*mahaggataṃ citta*) as ‘a developed mind’ (*mahaggataṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), an undeveloped mind (*amahaggataṃ citta*) as ‘an undeveloped mind’ (*amahaggataṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a surpassed mind (*sauttaraṃ citta*) as ‘a surpassed mind’ (*sauttaraṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), an unsurpassed mind (*anuttaraṃ citta*) as ‘an unsurpassed mind’ (*anuttaraṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a concentrated mind (*samāhitaṃ citta*) as ‘a concentrated mind’ (*samāhitaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), an unconcentrated mind (*asamāhitaṃ citta*) as ‘an unconcentrated mind’ (*asamāhitaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), a liberated mind (*vimuttaṃ citta*) as ‘a liberated mind’ (*vimuttaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*), and an unliberated mind (*avimuttaṃ citta*) as ‘an unliberated mind’ (*avimuttaṃ citta’nti pajānāti*)." 243.
“Just as, great king, a woman or a man, a young person, fond of adornment, examining their own facial reflection in a clear, bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know, if there were a spot, ‘It has a spot,’ and if there were no spot, ‘It has no spot,’ so too, great king, a *bhikṣu*, with their mind well-concentrated, purified, and cleansed, without blemish, free from imperfections, pliable, workable, steady, and having attained imperturbability, directs and inclines their mind towards the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others (*cetopariyañāṇa*).

They understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with their own mind. They understand a mind with lust (*sarāgaṃ citta*) as a mind with lust and a mind without lust (*vītarāgaṃ citta*) as a mind without lust; they understand a mind with hatred (*sadosaṃ citta*) as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred (*vītadosaṃ citta*) as a mind without hatred; they understand a mind with delusion (*samohaṃ citta*) as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion (*vītamohaṃ citta*) as a mind without delusion; they understand a contracted mind (*saṅkhittaṃ citta*) as a contracted mind and a distracted mind (*vikkhittaṃ citta*) as a distracted mind; they understand an exalted mind (*mahaggataṃ citta*) as an exalted mind and an unexalted mind (*amahaggataṃ citta*) as an unexalted mind; they understand a surpassable mind (*sauttaraṃ citta*) as a surpassable mind and an unsurpassed mind (*anuttaraṃ citta*) as an unsurpassed mind; they understand a concentrated mind (*samāhitaṃ citta*) as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind (*asamāhitaṃ citta*) as an unconcentrated mind; they understand a liberated mind (*vimuttaṃ citta*) as a liberated mind and an unliberated mind (*avimuttaṃ citta*) as an unliberated mind.

This too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sāmaññaphala*) more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

Knowledge of the recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇa*).

244.
And so, with mind well-concentrated, purified and cleansed, without blemish, free from imperfections, pliable, workable, steady, and having attained imperturbability, they direct and incline their mind towards the knowledge of recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇa*).

They recollect many past lives, that is, one birth (*jāti*), two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-contraction (*saṃvaṭṭakappa*), many eons of world-expansion (*vivaṭṭakappa*), many eons of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappa*), ‘There I was so named Of such a clan, of such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away thence, I was reborn here.’

Thus he remembers various past births, their conditions and details.

245.

"Great king, suppose a man were to go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village.

and thence return to his home village.

He might think: ‘I went from my own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from that village I went to that other village and there I stood in such a way…kept silent in such a way; and from that village I came back again to my own village.’

In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, without blemish, rid of defilements, gentle, pliable, steady, and has attained imperturbability, the *bhikkhu* directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives.

He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three, four, or five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty births; a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births; many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion: ‘There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that existence, I arose in another place. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance; such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my span of life. Passing away from that existence, I was reborn here.’ Thus he remembers various past births, their conditions and details.

This too, great king, is a visible fruit of the life of a recluse, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. Knowledge of the divine eye.

246. When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye ( *dibbena cakkhunā* ), which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and arising—inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings pass on according to their *karma* ( *yathākammūpage satte pajānāti* ), thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body (*kāyaduccaritena*), speech (*vacīduccaritena*), and mind (*manoduccaritena*), who reviled the noble ones (*ariyānaṃ upavādakā*), held wrong views (*micchādiṭṭhikā*), and undertook actions governed by wrong views (*micchādiṭṭhikammasamādānā*)—at the breaking up of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery (*apāyaṃ*), the bad destinations (*duggatiṃ*), the lower realms (*vinipātaṃ*), in hell (*nirayaṃ upapannā*). But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body (*kāyasucaritena*), speech (*vacīsucaritena*), and mind (*manosucaritena*), who did not revile the noble ones (*ariyānaṃ anupavādakā*), held right views (*sammādiṭṭhikā*), and undertook actions governed by right views (*sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā*)—at the break-up of the body, after death, have reappeared in the good destinations (*sugatiṃ*), in the heavenly world (*saggaṃ lokaṃ upapannā*) .’ Thus, with the divine eye ( *dibbena cakkhunā* ), purified and surpassing the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their *karma* ( *yathākammūpage satte pajānāti* ).

247. "Suppose, great king, there were a building with an upper terrace at a crossroads. A man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house, walking in the street, or sitting in the middle of the crossroads. He might think: ‘These people are entering a house, those are leaving it, those are walking along the street, and those are sitting in the middle of the crossroads.’ In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and has attained imperturbability, the *bhikkhu* directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye ( *dibbena cakkhunā* ), which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and arising—inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their *karma* ( *yathākammūpage satte pajānāti* ), thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body (*kāyaduccaritena*), speech (*vacīduccaritena*), and mind (*manoduccaritena*), who reviled the noble ones (*ariyānaṃ upavādakā*), held wrong views (*micchādiṭṭhikā*), and undertook actions governed by wrong views (*micchādiṭṭhikammasamādānā*)—at the breaking up of the body, after death, have reappeared in the plane of misery (*apāyaṃ*), the bad destinations (*duggatiṃ*), the lower realms (*vinipātaṃ*), in hell (*nirayaṃ upapannā*). Moreover, these worthy beings were endowed with good conduct in body (*kāyasucarita*), good conduct in speech (*vacīsucarita*), and good conduct in mind (*manosucarita*); they did not speak ill of the Noble Ones (*ariyānaṃ*), held right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*), and undertook actions based on right view (*sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā*).
Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, they have been reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world (*sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapannā’ti*).

Thus, with the divine eye (*dibbena cakkhunā*), purified and surpassing the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understands beings passing on according to their actions (*yathākammūpage satte pajānāti*).

This, O great king (*mahārāja*), is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sāmaññaphalaṃ*) more excellent and sublime than the previous ones (*purimehi sandiṭṭhikehi sāmaññaphalehi abhikkantatarañca paṇītatarañca*).

Knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (*āsavakkhayañāṇaṃ*).

248.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, malleable, workable, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (*āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

He understands according to reality: "This is suffering (*idaṃ dukkha*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the origin of suffering (*dukkhasamudayo*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the cessation of suffering (*dukkhanirodho*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering (*dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*)".

He understands according to reality: "These are the cankers (*āsavā*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the origin of the cankers (*āsavasamudayo*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the cessation of the cankers (*āsavanirodho*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the path leading to the cessation of the cankers (*āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*)".

Knowing thus, seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire (*kāmāsava*), liberated from the canker of becoming (*bhavāsava*), liberated from the canker of ignorance (*avijjāsava*). The knowledge arises in him: ‘It is liberated! (*vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti*)’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth (*khīṇā jāti*), the holy life has been lived (*vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ*), what had to be done has been done (*kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ*), there is nothing further beyond this (*nāparaṃ itthattāyā’ti pajānāti*).’

249.

"Just as, O great king (*mahārāja*), in a mountain glen there might be a lake with clear water, limpid and undisturbed (*udakarahado accho vippasanno anāvilo*).

There a man with good sight, standing on the bank, might see shellfish, gravel, and shoals of fish, both moving and standing still (*sippisambukampi sakkharakathalampi macchagumbampi carantampi tiṭṭhantampi*).

He might think: 'This lake is clear, limpid, and undisturbed (*ayaṃ kho udakarahado accho vippasanno anāvilo*).

There are these shellfish, gravel, and shoals of fish, both moving and standing still (*tatrime sippisambukāpi sakkharakathalāpi macchagumbāpi carantipi tiṭṭhantipī’ti*).

In the same way, O great king (*mahārāja*), when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, malleable, workable, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (*āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

'He understands according to reality: "This is suffering (*idaṃ dukkha*)"; he understands according to reality: "This is the origin of suffering (*dukkhasamudayo*)". He understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'
He understands as it really is: ‘These are the corruptions’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the origin of the corruptions’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the cessation of the corruptions’; he understands as it really is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the corruptions.’
Through his knowing and seeing thus, his mind is liberated from the corruption of sensual desire, from the corruption of becoming, and from the corruption of ignorance, and the knowledge arises in him: “This is deliverance!” And he knows: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here."
This, great king, is a fruit of the life of a recluse visible in this very life, more surpassing and sublime than the previous fruits of the life of a recluse.
And, great king, there is no other fruit of the life of a recluse visible here and now that is higher or more sublime than this one.
The report on Ajātasattu becoming a lay follower.

250.
When this was said, King Ajātasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir!
Just as, venerable sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the path to one who is lost, or hold up a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms, even so, venerable sir, has the Dhamma been made clear by the Blessed One in many ways.
I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Order of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅghañca* ).
May the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower ( *upāsakaṃ* ) who has gone for refuge ( *saraṇaṃ gataṃ* ) from this day forward, for as long as life lasts.
Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in my foolishness, in my delusion, in my unskillfulness, in that I, for the sake of sovereignty, deprived my father, a righteous man and a righteous king, of his life.
May the Blessed One accept my confession of transgression as a transgression, so that I may exercise restraint in the future."
251.
"Indeed, great king, a transgression overcame you, in your foolishness, in your delusion, in your unskillfulness, in that you deprived your father, a righteous man and a righteous king, of his life.
But since you, great king, having seen your transgression as a transgression, make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it from you.
This, great king, is progress in the discipline of the Noble One, that one sees one's transgression as such, makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes restraint in the future."
252.
When this was said, King Ajātasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, said this to the Blessed One: "Well then, venerable sir, now we will take our leave, as we are busy and have much to do."
"Now is the time, great king, to do as you think fit."
Then King Ajātasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, having delighted in and rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, circumambulating him, he departed.
253.
Then, soon after King Ajātasattu, son of Queen Vedehi, had departed, the Blessed One addressed the monks, saying: "Ruined is this king, monks.
Injured is this king, monks.
If this king had not deprived his father, a righteous man and a righteous king, of his life, the dust-free, stainless eye of the Dhamma ( *dhammacakkhuṃ* ) would have arisen in him while sitting in this very seat."
This is what the Blessed One said.
Delighted, those monks rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement.
The Sāmaññaphala Sutta is finished, the second. 18. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in wrangling argumentation, such as: “You don’t understand this *dharma* and *vinaya*—I do!” “How can you understand this *dharma* and *vinaya*?” “Your way is all wrong—mine is right!” “I am consistent—you aren’t!” “What should have been said first you said last, what should have been said last you said first!” “What you took so long to think up has been refuted!” “Your argument has been overthrown, you’re defeated!” ‘Go on, save your doctrine ( *vāda* )’—the recluse Gotama abstains from such wrangling argumentation.’ It is in this way, *bhikkhus*, that a worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

19. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in running messages and errands for kings ( *rajñam* ), ministers of state ( *rājamahāmattānam* ), *kṣatriyas*, *brāhmaṇas*, householders ( *gahapatikānam* ), or youths ( *kumārānam* ), such as: “Go here, go there, take this, bring that from there”—the recluse Gotama abstains from running such messages and errands.’ It is in this way, *bhikkhus*, that a worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

20. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in scheming ( *kuhakā* ), talking ( *lapakā* ), hinting ( *nemittikā* ), belittling others ( *nippesikā* ), and pursuing gain with gain—the recluse Gotama abstains from such kinds of scheming and talking.’ “It is in this way, *bhikkhus*, that a worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*. The intermediate morality ( *majjhimasīlaṃ* ) is finished. The great morality ( *mahāsīlaṃ* )

21. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood ( *micchājīvena* ), by such debased knowledge ( *tiracchānavijjāya* ) 3.

*Ambaṭṭha Sutta*

254. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala, and eventually arrived at a Kosalan Brahmin village named Icchānaṅgala, together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks.

And there the Blessed One dwelt in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.

*The Story of Pokkharasāti*

255. Now at that time, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti was dwelling at Ukkaṭṭha, a place teeming with life, with grass, wood and water, and with grain, a royal domain granted by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift, a sacred grant.

And the Brahmin Pokkharasāti heard, "The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyans, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala with a large Saṅgha of monks, and has arrived at Icchānaṅgala, and is dwelling in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.

Now concerning that venerable Gotama, such a good report has been spread about: ‘Thus indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a fully enlightened *sammāsambuddha*, perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjā-caraṇa-sampanno*), a *sugata*, knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed (*anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā deva-manussānaṃ*), the Buddha, the Blessed One.’

He makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and its *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its generations with their contemplatives & brahmins (*sassamaṇa-brāhmaṇiṃ*), their rulers & commonfolk; (*sadevamanussaṃ*)

He teaches the Dharma that is good at the beginning (*ādi-kalyāṇaṃ*) … he reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ parisuddhaṃ*).

…Now it is good see such *arhats*."

*Ambaṭṭha Māṇava*

256. Now at that time the Brahmin Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha, a young man (*māṇava*) who was a resident pupil (*antevāsī*), a reciter (*ajjhāyako*), a master of the *mantras* (*mantadharo*), versed in the three Vedas (*tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ pāragū*), with their vocabularies (*sanighaṇḍukeṭubhānaṃ*), the differentiation of their letters (*sākkharappabhedānaṃ*), and fifthly the traditions (*itihāsa-pañcamānaṃ*), skilled in word and sentence structure (*padako veyyākaraṇo*), and not subject to refutation in the systems of materialism (*lokāyata*) and the characteristics of a great man (*mahāpurisa-lakkhaṇesu anavayo*), acknowledged and accepted by his teacher in the Three Vedas In the context of speaking, it means: "You know the Dhamma that I know and I know the Dhamma that you know."

257. Then the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti addressed the *māṇava* Ambaṭṭha, saying: "Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, the son of the Śākyas, who has gone forth from the Śākya clan, is wandering in Kosala, and has arrived at Icchānangala with a great *bhikkhu-saṃgha*, with about five hundred *bhikkhus*, and is staying in the grove of Icchānangalavana.

And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama, a good report has spread about thus: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), Knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), an unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed Lord (*bhagavā*)'.

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and its *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), this generation with its *śramaṇas* and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its rulers and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dharma* (*dhammaṃ*), which is lovely in its beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), lovely in its ending (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), in the spirit (*sātthaṃ*) and in the letter (*sabyañjanaṃ*), and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).

It is good to see such *arhats*."

"Come, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the *śramaṇa* Gotama; having gone, find out about the *śramaṇa* Gotama; whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

Whether the Reverend Gotama is such, or not, in that way we shall know the Reverend Gotama."

258. "But how, sir, shall I know the Reverend Gotama—whether the report about the Reverend Gotama is as it is, or not.

Whether the Reverend Gotama is such, or not?"

"It has come down to us, dear Ambaṭṭha, in our *mantras*, that the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇāni*) has only two courses open to him, no other.

If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law (*cakravartin*), a righteous king (*dhammarājā*), conqueror of the four quarters (*cāturanto*), all-victorious (*vijitāvī*), who has established the security of his realm (*janapadatthāvariyappatto*) and is possessed of the seven treasures (*sattaratanasamannāgato*).

He has these seven treasures (*satta ratanāni*):

Namely: the wheel-treasure (*cakkaratanaṃ*), the elephant-treasure (*hatthiratanaṃ*), the horse-treasure (*assaratanaṃ*), the jewel-treasure (*maṇiratanaṃ*), the woman-treasure (*itthiratanaṃ*), the householder-treasure (*gahapatiratanaṃ*), and the counsellor-treasure (*pariṇāyakaratanameva*) as the seventh.

He has more than a thousand sons (*parosahassaṃ kho panassa puttā*). They are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army.
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the Dhamma.
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an *arhat* (arahant), a *sammāsambuddha* (fully-enlightened Buddha), one who draws back the veil from the world.
And, Ambattha, I am the giver of the *mantras*, and you are the receiver.

"Very good, sir", said Ambattha, the young Brahmin, assenting to the words of the Brahmin Pokkharasāti. He rose from his seat, respectfully circumambulated Pokkharasāti, and mounting his chariot drawn by a mare, proceeded with a large number of young men towards the grove of Icchānaṅgala.
He drove as far as the carriage could go, then alighted from the carriage and continued on foot into the park.
Now at that time a number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air.
Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, approached those monks and said to them: "Where, indeed, is the revered Gotama currently staying? For we have come here to see the revered Gotama".

Then the monks thought: "This Ambattha, the young Brahmin, is of well-known lineage and a pupil of the renowned Brahmin Pokkharasāti.
It would not trouble the Blessed One to have a conversation with such a young man".
They said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "That is the dwelling (*vihāra*) of the Blessed One, with its doors shut. Approach it quietly, without haste, enter the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the bolt. The Blessed One will open the door for you".

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, went to the dwelling (*vihāra*) with the closed door. Approaching it quietly and without haste, he entered the porch, cleared his throat, and knocked on the bolt.
The Blessed One opened the door.
Ambattha, the young Brahmin, entered.
The young men also entered, exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging polite and courteous conversation, sat down to one side.
But Ambattha, the young Brahmin, even while walking, exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting. Even while standing, he exchanged some polite conversation with the Blessed One, who was sitting.

Then the Blessed One said to Ambattha, the young Brahmin: "Is this how you converse with venerable and learned Brahmins, elderly teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, uttering vague words of politeness?"
First denigration of becoming.

"No, Master Gotama.
For a Brahmin should converse with a Brahmin who is walking while walking, with a Brahmin who is standing while standing, with a Brahmin who is sitting while sitting, and with a Brahmin who is lying down while lying down.
Those shaven, petty ascetics, menials, the black offspring of Brahma's feet—it is fitting to speak with them as I do with the Reverend Gotama.”
“Ambattha, you came here seeking something. For whatever purpose you came, you should carefully attend to that purpose.
Ambattha, this worthy young man has not perfected his training. His conceit of being trained stems merely from his inexperience."

Then Ambattha, the young Brahmin, being addressed with the words of one untrained, became angry and displeased. Reviling the Blessed One, berating the Blessed One, disparaging the Blessed One, he said this to the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is malicious to me!" "The Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are fierce; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are rough; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are flighty; the Sakyans, Reverend Gotama, are abusive. Though menial, being menial, they do not honor Brahmins, they do not respect Brahmins.
kaṃ: A kind of *bīja*; well; for the benefit of (after a dative).
pī: reduplication for pyāy; schm￤hen; hassen; spotten; to taunt.
na: not; no; nor; neither; like. They do not esteem the Brahmins, they do not venerate the Brahmins, they do not respect the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the first time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Second Charge of Menial Birth

“What then, Ambaṭṭha, have the Śākyas done against you?” “Once, venerable Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business or other for Pokkharasāti, the Brahmin, my teacher.

I went to the meeting-hall of the Śākyas.

And at that time many Śākyas and Śākya youths were sitting on high seats in the meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing, and, I thought, making fun of me; and no one even invited me to sit down.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the second time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas.

The Third Charge of Menial Birth

“Even the quail, Ambaṭṭha, little bird that it is, can say what it likes in its own nest.

This Kapilavatthu belongs to the Śākyas, Ambaṭṭha, and venerable Ambaṭṭha does not deserve to be censured for this trifle.”

“There are these four classes, Gotama: the nobles, the Brahmins, the merchants, and the laborers.

And of these four classes, Gotama, three classes – the nobles, the merchants, and the laborers – are simply the servants of the Brahmins.

'Regarding this, Gotama, it is unseemly, it is not fitting that these Śākyas, menials though they are, being menials, should not honor the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins, should not esteem the Brahmins, should not venerate the Brahmins, should not respect the Brahmins.’”

This, it seems, was the third time that Ambaṭṭha the student cast the charge of menial birth against the Śākyas. “Insulting with the claim of being born of a slave."

267. Then the Lord thought: 'This Ambaṭṭha, young man, goes too far in abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan?"
Then the Lord said to Ambaṭṭha, the young man: "What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?" "I am a Kaṇhāyana, venerable Gotama."
'Ambaṭṭha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl (*dāsiputto*) of the Sakyans.
For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor.
At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika and Sinisūra.
And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters.
"Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and courtiers: ‘Where, pray, are the princes now staying?’ ‘There is, O King, on the flank of the Himalayas, beside a lotus-pond, a big grove of teak-trees; that is where the princes are now staying. And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabit with their own sisters.’
At this King Okkāka exclaimed: “They are strong as teak, these princes, they are real Sakyans!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Sakyans have been known as such; and he was their first ancestor.
"Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā.
She gave birth to a black child ( *kaṇhaṃ*).
The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!”
Because, Ambaṭṭha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black.
And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!”
From that time forth, Ambaṭṭha, the Kaṇhāyanas have been known as such; and he was the first ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas. "Because when you, Ambaṭṭha, recall your ancient lineage through both mother and father, the Sakyans are the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans."

268. When this was said, the young men said to the Blessed One: "Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambaṭṭha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave-girl.

Ambaṭṭha, Reverend Gotama, is well-born, Ambaṭṭha is of a good family, Ambaṭṭha is very learned, Ambaṭṭha is well-spoken, Ambaṭṭha is a scholar, Ambaṭṭha is well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!"

269. Then the Lord said to the young men: "If you consider that Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambaṭṭha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me.

But if you think he is well-born, of a good family, very learned, well-spoken, a scholar, able to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then you be quiet, and let Ambaṭṭha discuss with me."

"Ambaṭṭha is well-born, Reverend Gotama, Ambaṭṭha is of a good family, Ambaṭṭha is very learned, Ambaṭṭha is well-spoken, Ambaṭṭha is a scholar, Ambaṭṭha is well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama. We will be silent, let Ambaṭṭha continue this discussion with the Reverend Gotama."

270. Then the Lord said to Ambaṭṭha: "Ambaṭṭha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer.

If you don’t answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent,

or go away, your head will split into seven pieces.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kaṇhāyanas came from, or who was their ancestor?"

At this, Ambaṭṭha remained silent.

The Lord asked him a second time: "What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kaṇhāyanas came from, or who was their ancestor?" Again Ambaṭṭha remained silent.

Then the Lord said to Ambaṭṭha: "Answer me now, Ambaṭṭha, this is not a time for silence.

Whoever, Ambaṭṭha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a *Tathāgata* by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces."

271. And at that moment Vajirapāṇi the *yakṣa*, holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambaṭṭha, was thinking: "If this young man Ambaṭṭha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!"

The Lord saw Vajirapāṇi the *yakṣa*, and so did Ambaṭṭha.

272. And at the sight, Ambaṭṭha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said: "What did the Reverend Gotama say? Let the Reverend Gotama repeat it!"

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, who was the ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas?" "Yes, Reverend Gotama, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said.

That is where the Kaṇhāyanas came from, he was their ancestor." The Story of the Lineage of Ambaṭṭha.

273.
When this was said, those youths, being noisy, made a loud and great noise, saying: "Ambaṭṭha the youth is indeed ill-born, sir! Ambaṭṭha the youth is indeed not of good family, sir! Ambaṭṭha the youth is indeed the son of a slave girl of the Śākyas, sir!

The Śākyas, sir, are indeed the masters of Ambaṭṭha the youth.

Indeed, we thought that the ascetic Gotama should only be disparaged as a speaker of truth!"

274.
Then the Blessed One thought: "These youths excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl. What if I were to liberate him from that?"

Then, the Blessed One said this to those youths: "Do not, youths, excessively humiliate Ambaṭṭha the youth with the accusation of being the son of a slave girl.

That Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) was a mighty sage (ṛṣi).

Having gone to the Southern country and learned the *brahma*-mantras, he approached King Okkāka and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī.

To him, King Okkāka said: ‘Who is this fellow who, being the son of a slave-girl, dares to ask for Maddarūpī, my daughter?’ Angered and displeased, he fitted an arrow (khurappaṃ).

He was unable either to release that arrow or to withdraw it.

Then, youths, the ministers and courtiers approached the sage Kanhha (Kṛṣṇa) and said: 'May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king!'

‘There will be well-being to the king, and if the king releases the arrow downwards, to the extent of the king's realm, the earth will quake.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and if the king releases the arrow upwards, for seven years, to the extent of the king's realm, the god (deva) will not send rain.’

‘May there be well-being (svasti), reverend sir (bhadante), to the king; may there be well-being (svasti) to the land, and may the god (deva) send rain!’

‘There will be well-being to the king; there will be well-being to the land, and the god (deva) will send rain, and if the king aims the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), the prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).’

Then, youths, the ministers announced to Okkāka: 'Let Okkāka aim the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre).

The prince will be perfectly safe (pallomo).'

Then King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the eldest prince (jeṭṭhakumāre), and the prince was safe (sotthi). He became perfectly safe.
Then King Okkaka, terrified and fearful, with his hair standing on end, punished by the divine punishment, gave his daughter Maddarupi.
So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl. That Kaṇha was a mighty sage.’
The superiority of the warrior (Kṣatriya) class.

Then the Lord addressed the youth Ambattha: ‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Khattiya youth were to cohabit with a Brahmin maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his mother’s side, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose a Brahmin youth were to cohabit with a Khattiya maiden, and a son were to be born from their cohabitation?
Would that son born of a Brahmin youth and a Khattiya maiden be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would Khattiyas consecrate him with the Khattiya consecration?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What is the reason for that?’ ‘Because he is not well-born on his father’s side, Reverend Gotama.’

‘So, Ambattha, whether a woman takes a man or a man takes a woman, the Khattiyas are superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Brahmins shaved the head of a Brahmin for some reason,

and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.
Would he be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Covered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose the Khattiyas shaved the head of a Khattiya for some reason, and after smearing him with ashes, banished him from the country or the city.
Would he be likely to receive a seat or water from the Brahmins?’ ‘He would receive it, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins allow him to eat at funeral rites, at ceremonial milk-rice offerings, at sacrifices, or as a guest?’ ‘They would allow him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would the Brahmins teach him *mantras*, or not?’ ‘They would teach him, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would their women be kept covered or uncovered in his presence?’ ‘Uncovered indeed, Reverend Gotama.’

‘But that Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation when the Khattiyas shave his head, and after smearing him with ashes, banish him from the country or the city.
So, Ambattha, even when a Khattiya has reached the extreme of humiliation, the Khattiyas are still superior, and the Brahmins are inferior.
This verse was uttered by Brahmā Sanankumāra:
‘The Khattiya is the best among people,
who value lineage.’
He is endowed with knowledge and conduct,
he is the best of gods and humans.”
“That verse, Ambaṭṭha, was well sung, not ill-sung, well spoken, not ill-spoken, connected with meaning, not unconnected with meaning, approved by me, by Brahmā Sanankumāra.
And I too, Ambaṭṭha, say this: The Khattiya is the best among those who value clan;
He with knowledge and conduct,
is best of gods and men.”
End of the first recitation-section.
The discourse on knowledge and conduct.
278.
"But what, Venerable Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "It is not, Ambaṭṭha, in the pursuit of the unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct that talk of birth, clan, or conceit arises—‘You are worthy of me, or you are not worthy of me.’
For wherever, Ambaṭṭha, there is a giving, a taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceint—‘You are worthy of me, or you are not worthy of me.’
But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct.
Only by abandoning talk of birth, clan, and conceit and the giving and taking in marriage, can the unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct be realized."
279.
"But what, Venerable Gotama, is conduct, and what is knowledge?" "Here, Ambaṭṭha, a Tathāgata arises in the world, a worthy one, a rightly self-awakened one, impeccable in conduct and understanding, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed, trainer of beings, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed one.
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people.
He teaches the Dhamma, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.
A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma.
Having heard this Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata.
He, being endowed with that acquisition of faith, reflects thus... (as in 191, these passages should be expanded in the same way).
…
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation… this is part of his conduct.
“Again, with the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, the monk enters & remains in the second *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’… this is part of his conduct.
“And further, with the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—the monk enters & remains in the fourth *jhāna*: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain… this is part of his conduct.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is conduct.
“With his mind thus serene, purified, cleansed, without blemish, rid of defilement, supple, malleable, firm, & attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision… this is part of his knowledge… he understands, ‘There is nothing further for this state of being’… this is part of his knowledge.
This, Ambaṭṭha, is knowledge.
“This, Ambaṭṭha, is what is called a monk who is ‘accomplished in knowledge,’ ‘accomplished in conduct,’ and ‘accomplished in knowledge & conduct.’
And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.
Four paths of failure.

"But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and condact there are four paths of failure.
What are the four? Here, Ambaṭṭha, some recluse or Brahmin, without attaining this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, Taking various sorts of *khāri* vessels, he enters a forest dwelling, thinking, "I will live on windfalls." But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the first path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), and being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket and enters a forest grove, thinking, 'I will live on tubers, roots, and fruits.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the second path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, and being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame. But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the third path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

"Again, Ambaṭṭha, some ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to fully realize this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttaraṃ vijjācaraṇasampadaṃ*), being unable to live on windfalls, being unable to live on tubers, roots, and fruits, and being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: 'Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from these four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.'" But in this way, he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampadā*). This, Ambaṭṭha, is the fourth path of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct.

These, Ambaṭṭha, are the four paths of failure in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct (*anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya*).

"What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct (*anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya*)?" "No, Master Gotama."

‘What am I, They make their living by such base arts, such as: palmistry (*aṅga*), divining by signs (*nimitta*), portents (*uppāta*), dreams (*supinaṃ*), body-marks (*lakkhaṇaṃ*), mouse-gnawings (*mūsikacchinnaṃ*), fire-oblations (*aggihomaṃ*), oblations from a ladle (*dabbihomaṃ*), oblations of husks (*thusahomaṃ*), oblations of rice powder (*kaṇahomaṃ*), oblations of rice grains (*taṇḍulahomaṃ*), oblations of ghee (*sappihomaṃ*), oblations of oil (*telahomaṃ*), oblations from the mouth (*mukhahomaṃ*), oblations of blood (*lohitahomaṃ*), reading the finger-tips (*aṅgavijjā*), house- and garden-lore (*vatthuvijjā*), skill in charms (*khattavijjā*), ghost-lore (*sivavijjā*), earth-house lore (*bhūtavijjā*), snake-lore (*bhūrivijjā*), poison-lore (*ahivijjā*), rat-lore (*visavijjā*), bird-lore (*vicchikavijjā*), crow-lore (*mūsikavijjā*), foretelling a person’s life-span (*sakuṇavijjā*), charms against arrows (*vāyasavijjā*), knowledge of animals’ cries (*pakkajjhānaṃ*), the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts. Thus, indeed, mendicants, a worldling, when speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak.

22.
"Or he might say: 'Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as interpreting the significance of the colour, shape, and other features of the following items to determine whether they portend fortune or misfortune for their owners: gems (*maṇilakkhaṇaṃ*), garments (*vatthalakkhaṇaṃ*), staffs (*daṇḍalakkhaṇaṃ*), swords (*satthalakkhaṇaṃ*), spears (*asilakkhaṇaṃ*), arrows (*usulakkhaṇaṃ*), bows (*dhanulakkhaṇaṃ*), other weapons (*āvudhalakkhaṇaṃ*), women (*itthilakkhaṇaṃ*), men (*purisalakkhaṇaṃ*), boys (*kumāralakkhaṇaṃ*), girls (*kumārilakkhaṇaṃ*), slaves (*dāsalakkhaṇaṃ*), slave-women (*dāsilakkhaṇaṃ*), elephants (*hatthilakkhaṇaṃ*), horses (*assalakkhaṇaṃ*), buffaloes (*mahiṃsalakkhaṇaṃ*), bulls (*usabhalakkhaṇaṃ*), cows (*golakkhaṇaṃ*), goats (*ajalakkhaṇaṃ*), rams (*meṇḍalakkhaṇaṃ*), cocks (*kukkuṭalakkhaṇaṃ*), quail (*vaṭṭakalakkhaṇaṃ*), iguanas (*godhālakkhaṇaṃ*), bamboo-rats (*kaṇṇikālakkhaṇaṃ*), tortoises (*kacchapalakkhaṇaṃ*), deer (*migalakkhaṇaṃ*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts. Thus, indeed, mendicants, a worldling, when speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak.

23.
"Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as making predictions to the effect that: the king will march forth (*raññaṃ niyyānaṃ bhavissati*); the king will not march forth (*raññaṃ aniyyānaṃ bhavissati*); our king will attack (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ upayānaṃ bhavissati*) and the enemy king will retreat (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ apayānaṃ bhavissati*); the enemy king will attack (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ upayānaṃ bhavissati*) and our king will retreat (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ apayānaṃ bhavissati*); our king will triumph (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ jayo bhavissati*) and the enemy king will be defeated (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ parājayo bhavissati*); the enemy king will triumph (*bāhirānaṃ raññaṃ jayo bhavissati*) and our king will be defeated (*abbhantarānaṃ raññaṃ parājayo bhavissati*); thus there will be victory for one (*iti imassa jayo bhavissati*) and defeat for the other (*imassa parājayo bhavissati*)—the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts. Thus, indeed, mendicants, a worldling, when speaking in praise of the *tathāgata*, might speak. “Well then, Gotama, are you and your teacher endowed with the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct? I am far from the unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, take up a spade and basket and go into the depths of the forest, intending to live on tubers and roots?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, build a fire-hut near a village or town, tending the fire?” “No, Gotama.”

“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, live on windfalls and, being unable to gain that, live on tubers and roots and, being unable to gain that, tend the fire and, being unable to gain that, build a four-doored rest-house at the crossroads in the hopes that whatever ascetic or Brahmin comes from the four directions, we will honor and serve him according to our ability and power?” “No, Gotama.”

And so, Ambaṭṭha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled perfection of knowledge and conduct, but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.

And yet you and your teacher the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti utter these words: “These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed.

See how your teacher has let you down!

Following the conduct of the ancient seers

The *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala.

And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face.

When he confers with the King it is through a curtain.

Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

See how your teacher has let you down!

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something.

And suppose he were to step aside.

And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. And standing there he might say: “This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!”

Would he be speaking the King’s words, or conferring about the King’s business? Would he to that extent be the King, or a royal minister?” “No, Gotama.”

Well then, Ambaṭṭha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the *brāhmaṇas* of today — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu — whose *mantras* are said to be passed on to you and your teacher: yet you do not thereby become a *ṛṣi* or one practiced in the way of a *ṛṣi* — such a thing is impossible.

What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? What have you heard said by *brāhmaṇas* who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first *ṛṣis* of the *brāhmaṇas*, the makers and expounders of the *mantras*, Those ancient verses which the Brahmins of today chant, pronounce and collect, whose origin lies with brahmin seers of the past, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns — Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa & Bhagu—did they live well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with jewels, earrings and ornaments, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they eat special fine rice with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“…pe… Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords, as you and your teacher do now?” “No, Master Gotama.”

“So, Ambaṭṭha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage.
And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.”
Display of the Two Characteristics.

287.
Then the Lord, leaving his dwelling, started to walk up and down.
Ambaṭṭha also, leaving his dwelling, started to walk up and down.
And as Ambaṭṭha walked alongside the Lord as he was walking up and down, he observed the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body.
Ambaṭṭha saw on the Lord's body the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, but he was doubtful about two of them.
He was doubtful and perplexed about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.

288.
Then the Lord thought: "This Ambaṭṭha sees the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two.
He is doubtful and perplexed about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue."
Then the Lord worked such a feat of supernormal power that Ambaṭṭha saw that the Lord’s male organ was enclosed in a sheath.
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue.
Then Ambaṭṭha thought: “The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.”
Then he said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’
"Ambaṭṭha, do what you now think fit."
So Ambaṭṭha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.

289.
At that time, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambaṭṭha.
Then Ambaṭṭha came to the park.
He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side.

290.
Then Pokkharasati said to Ambaṭṭha, who was sitting to one side: ‘Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?’ ‘Yes, I saw the Reverend Gotama.’
‘And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be, and not otherwise? And is he of such nature, and not ‘And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?" "Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such a nature, and not otherwise.

He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing.’

“But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?” “There was, sir.”

‘And what was this conversation about?” Then Ambaṭṭha the student told the Brahmin Pokkharasāti all that had passed between the Lord and himself.

291.

At this Pokkharasāti exclaimed: ‘Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell!

You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!

You’re a fine little scholar…!” He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambaṭṭha over,

and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord.

Pokkharasāti's visit to the Buddha

292.

But the Brahmins said: ‘It is far too late, sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today.

The Reverend Pokkharasāti should go to see him tomorrow.’

Then the Brahmin Pokkharasāti had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had it loaded onto vehicles, and at the torches... He set out for Ukkaṭṭhā while they were being borne along and headed towards the Icchānaṅgala woodland.
Going by vehicle as far as the ground was suitable for vehicles, he dismounted and approached the Blessed One on foot.
Having approached, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One, and after exchanging friendly and courteous conversation, he sat down to one side.

293.
Seated to one side, the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti said this to the Blessed One: "Did our pupil Ambaṭṭha, the young man, come here, venerable Gotama?" "Yes, *brāhmaṇa*, our pupil Ambaṭṭha, the young man, came here."
"Did you have any conversation with Ambaṭṭha, the young man, venerable Gotama?" "Yes, *brāhmaṇa*, I had some conversation with Ambaṭṭha, the young man."
"What sort of conversation did you have with Ambaṭṭha, the young man, venerable Gotama?" Then the Blessed One told the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti all the conversation he had had with Ambaṭṭha, the young man.
When this was said, the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti said this to the Blessed One: "Ambaṭṭha, the young man, is a fool, venerable Gotama. May venerable Gotama forgive Ambaṭṭha, the young man."
"May Ambaṭṭha, the young man, be happy, *brāhmaṇa*."

294.
Then the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti examined the Blessed One's body for the thirty-two marks of a great man (*dvattiṃsa-mahāpurisa-lakkhaṇāni*).
The *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti saw most of the thirty-two marks of a great man on the Blessed One’s body, except for two.
He doubted, was uncertain, could not decide, and was not convinced about two marks of a great man: the concealed genitals (*kosohite vatthaguyhe*) and the large tongue (*pahūtajivhatāya*).

295.
Then it occurred to the Blessed One: "This *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti sees most of the thirty-two marks of a great man on me, except for two.
He doubts, is uncertain, cannot decide, and is not convinced about two marks of a great man: the concealed genitals (*kosohite vatthaguyhe*) and the large tongue (*pahūtajivhatāya*)."
Then the Blessed One manifested such a feat of psychic power (*iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkhāsi*) that the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti saw the Blessed One's concealed genitals (*kosohitaṃ vatthaguyhaṃ*).
Then Then, indeed, the Blessed One, having extended his tongue, stroked and touched both ear-holes, stroked and touched both nostrils, and covered even the entire circle of his forehead with his tongue.

296. Then, indeed, the brahmin Pokkharasāti thought: "The ascetic Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man (*dvattiṃsamahāpurisalakkhaṇehi*), complete and not incomplete."

He said this to the Blessed One: "May the honored Gotama accept a meal today with the Order of Monks."

The Blessed One accepted in silence.

297. Then, indeed, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, knowing of the Blessed One's acceptance, announced the time to the Blessed One: "It is time, honored Gotama, the meal is ready."

Then, indeed, the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning time, taking his bowl and robe, together with the Order of Monks, went to the residence of the brahmin Pokkharasāti; having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat.

Then, indeed, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, with his own hands, satisfied and served the Blessed One with delicious foods, both hard and soft; and the young men [served] the Order of Monks.

Then, indeed, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, taking a certain low seat, sat down to one side.

298. As the brahmin Pokkharasāti was sitting to one side, the Blessed One gave a progressive talk, that is to say, a talk on giving (*dānakathaṃ*), a talk on virtue (*sīlakathaṃ*), a talk on heaven (*saggakathaṃ*), the danger, wretchedness, and corruption of sensual pleasures (*kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ*), and he revealed the benefit of renunciation (*nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ*).

When the Blessed One knew that the brahmin Pokkharasāti's mind was pliant, soft, free from hindrances, uplifted, and serene, then he revealed that teaching on the Dhamma (*dhammadesanā*) which is unique to the Buddhas: suffering (*dukkhaṃ*), its origin (*samudayaṃ*), its cessation (*nirodhaṃ*), and the path (*maggaṃ*).

Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly absorb dye, even so, as the brahmin Pokkharasāti was sitting in that very seat, the stainless and immaculate eye of the Dharma (*dhammacakkhuṃ*) arose in him: "Whatever is subject to arising, all that is subject to cessation."

Declaration of Pokkharasāti as a lay follower.

299. Then, indeed, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, having seen the Dharma (*diṭṭhadhammo*), having attained the Dharma (*pattadhammo*), having known the Dharma (*viditadhammo*), having fathomed the Dharma (*pariyogāḷhadhammo*), having crossed over doubt (*tiṇṇavicikiccho*), having eliminated perplexity (*vigatakathaṃkatho*) 4. The Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta
Brahmins and Householders of Campā

300. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was travelling among the Aṅgas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at Campā.

At Campā he stayed by the bank of the Gaggarā lotus pond.

At that time, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living at Campā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and grain, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift, a royal endowment, a sacred grant.

301. And the Brahmins and householders of Campā heard say: “The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Aṅgas… and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pool.

concerning whom a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arhat, a fully-enlightened Buddha ( *sammāsambuddho*), perfected in knowledge and conduct ( *vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer ( *sugato*), Knower of the worlds ( *lokavidū*), unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed ( *anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), Teacher of gods and humans ( *satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.”

He proclaims this world with its gods ( *sadevakaṃ*), its Māras ( *samārakaṃ*), and its Brahmās ( *sabrahmakaṃ*), this generation with its recluses and brahmins ( *sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and its people ( *sadevamanussaṃ*), which he has himself realised by direct knowledge ( *abhiññā sacchikatvā*).

He teaches the Dhamma that is good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end; with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals the spiritual life ( *brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure.

It is good to see such Arahants.’“

Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campā, leaving Campā in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

302. Just then, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest.

Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggara’s lotus-pond,

he asked his steward the reason. Having departed from Campā, they are approaching the Gaggara Pond in a group, a host." "Sir, the ascetic **Gautama** (**Gotama**), a son of the **Śākyas**, who went forth from the **Śākya** clan, wandering in Aṅga, has arrived at Campā with a large community of monks, about five hundred monks, and is staying on the bank of the Gaggara Pond in Campā.

A good report of the venerable **Gautama** has spread abroad: "Indeed, that Blessed One is an *arahant*, a perfectly enlightened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of those who can be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed."

They are approaching the venerable **Gautama** for a sight (of him)."

"Then, steward, go to the **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) and householders of Campeyya and say to them: 'The brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa says this: "Please wait, gentlemen, the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him)."'"

"Yes, sir," the steward replied to the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa, and he went to the **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) and householders of Campeyya, and having approached the **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) and householders of Campeyya, he said this: "The brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa says this: 'Please wait, gentlemen, the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him)."'"

The story of Soṇadaṇḍa's virtues.

303.

Then, on that occasion, some five hundred **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) from various realms were residing in Campā for some business or other.

The **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) heard: "The brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa, it is said, will approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him)."

Then the **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins) approached the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa, and having approached the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa, they said this: "Is it true that the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him)?" "Yes, gentlemen, this is what I intend: 'I too will approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him).'"

"May the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa not approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him).

It is not fitting for the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa to approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him).

If the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa approaches the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him),

those who desire the meaning of the *mantras* (spells), who wish to study the *mantras* (spells), will come near the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa…

"The esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa is old, aged, advanced in years, has reached the last stage, is advanced in age; the ascetic **Gautama** is young and recently gone forth…

"The esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa is revered, respected, esteemed, worshipped, honored by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha…

"The esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa is revered, respected, esteemed, worshipped, honored by the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Pokkharasāti…

"The esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa dwells in Campā, a populous place, with grass, timber, water, and grain in abundance, a royal domain, granted by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, a royal gift, a *brahmadeyya* (Brahmin-grant).

Since the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa dwells in Campā, a populous place, with grass, timber, water, and grain in abundance, a royal domain, granted by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, a royal gift, a *brahmadeyya* (Brahmin-grant).

Because of this disadvantage, the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa should not approach the ascetic **Gautama** for a sight (of him); rather, the ascetic **Gautama** should approach the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa for a sight (of him)."

The story of the Buddha's virtues.

304.

When this was said, the brāhmaṇa (Brahmin) Soṇadaṇḍa said this to those **brāhmaṇas** (Brahmins):

"Then, gentlemen, listen to me, as to why we alone are fit to approach the venerable **Gautama** for a sight (of him), but the venerable **Gautama** is not fit to approach us for a sight (of him).

The ascetic **Gautama**, gentlemen, is well-born on both sides, from both mother and father, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished, irreproachable in regard to birth.

Since the venerable ascetic **Gautama** is well-born on both sides, from both mother and father, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished, irreproachable in regard to birth, because of this disadvantage, that venerable **Gautama** is not fit for our sight. Indeed, King Pasenadi of Kosala has gone for refuge to the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama), together with his son, his wife, his entourage and his ministers.
Indeed, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti has gone for refuge to the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama), together with his son, his wife, his entourage and his ministers.
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama) is esteemed, made much of, honored, revered and venerated by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha.
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama) is esteemed, made much of, honored, revered and venerated by King Pasenadi of Kosala.
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama) is esteemed, made much of, honored, revered and venerated by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti.
The ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama) has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests.
And guests should be honored, respected, revered, and venerated by us.
Having come to Campa and staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama (Śramaṇa Gautama) is our guest, and guests should be honored, respected, revered, and venerated by us.
Therefore it is not proper that the esteemed Gotama (Gotamaḥ) should come to visit us.
But rather we are fit to visit the esteemed Gotama (Gotamaṃ).
However much I might praise the honored Gotama (Gotamassa), the honored Gotama (Gotamo) is not just that much.
Indeed the honored Gotama (Gotamo) is of immeasurable praise.
305.
When this was said, the Brahmins said this to the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa: ‘Sir, since the esteemed Soṇadaṇḍa speaks in praise of the ascetic Gotama (Gotamassa), even if that esteemed Gotama (Gotamo) were staying a hundred yojanas away, it would be quite fitting for a believing clansman to go visit him, even with a shoulder-bag.’
“Then, sir, let us all go to visit the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ)."
The thought of Soṇadaṇḍa

306.
Then the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggara's lotus pond.
Then, when the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had gone into the forest thicket, this thought arose in his mind: "If I were to ask the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ) a question, and the ascetic Gotama (Gotamo) were to say to me, 'That is not the way to ask the question, Brahmin, this is the way to ask the question,' then this assembly would despise me, saying, 'The Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is a fool, he is incompetent, he could not ask the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ) a question properly.'"
If this assembly were to despise someone, his reputation would suffer.
If someone's reputation were to suffer, his income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
If the ascetic Gotama (Gotamo) were to ask me a question, and I could not satisfy his mind with an explanation of that question, and the ascetic Gotama (Gotamo) were to say to me, 'That is not the way to explain the question, Brahmin, this is the way to explain the question,' then this assembly would despise me, saying, 'The Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is a fool, he is incompetent, he could not satisfy the mind of the ascetic Gotama (Gotamassa) with an explanation of the question.'"
If this assembly were to despise someone, his reputation would suffer.
If someone's reputation were to suffer, his income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
If, having come so near, I were to turn back without even seeing the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ), this assembly would despise me, saying: ‘The Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is a fool, incompetent, arrogant, and fearful, and cannot bear to visit the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ). How could he, having come so near, turn back without seeing the ascetic Gotama (Gotamaṃ)?’"
If this assembly were to despise someone, his reputation would suffer.
If someone's reputation were to suffer, his income would also suffer, for our income depends on gaining a reputation."

307.
Then the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa went to where the Blessed One (Bhagavā) was, and exchanged greetings with the Blessed One (Bhagavatā).
When the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side.
The Campeyyakas also... Some of the *brāhmaṇa* householders, having bowed down to the Blessed One (bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā), sat down to one side. Some exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One (bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu), and after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies (sammodanīyaṃ kathaṃ sāraṇīyaṃ vītisāretvā), sat down to one side. Some, having raised their hands palm-to-palm in front of the heart towards the Blessed One (yena bhagavā tenañjaliṃ paṇāmetvā), sat down to one side. Some, after announcing their name and clan (nāmagottaṃ sāvetvā), sat down to one side. Some, remaining silent (tuṇhībhūtā), sat down to one side.

308.

There, too, Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa*, was sitting, reflecting much on this very idea: "If I were to ask the *samaṇa* Gotama a question (samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ pañhaṃ puccheyyaṃ), and if the *samaṇa* Gotama were to say to me thus: 'This, *brāhmaṇa*, is not the way to ask the question; this, *brāhmaṇa*, is how the question should be asked,' then this assembly (parisā) would despise me: 'Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa* is a fool, inept, he could not ask the *samaṇa* Gotama a question properly (yoniso pañhaṃ pucchitu)’nti."

And if anyone were despised by this assembly (parisā paribhaveyya), his reputation (yaso) would suffer (hāyetha).

And if a man’s reputation (yaso hāyetha) suffers, his income (bhogā) would suffer (hāyeyyuṃ).

For our income (bhogā) depends on the gaining of reputation (yasoladdhā kho panamhākaṃ bhogā).

"And if the *samaṇa* Gotama were to ask me a question (pañhaṃ puccheyya), and I could not satisfy his mind (cittaṃ na ārādheyyaṃ) with an explanation of that question (pañhassa veyyākaraṇena), and if the *samaṇa* Gotama were to say to me thus: 'This, *brāhmaṇa*, is not the way to explain the question (pañho evaṃ byākātabbo); this, *brāhmaṇa*, is how the question should be explained (pañho byākātabbo),' then this assembly (parisā) would despise me: 'Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa* is a fool, inept, he could not satisfy the mind (cittaṃ ārādhetu) of the *samaṇa* Gotama with an explanation of the question (pañhassa veyyākaraṇena)’nti."

And if anyone were despised by this assembly (parisā paribhaveyya), his reputation (yaso) would suffer (hāyetha).

And if a man’s reputation (yaso hāyetha) suffers, his income (bhogā) would suffer (hāyeyyuṃ).

For our income (bhogā) depends on the gaining of reputation (yasoladdhā kho panamhākaṃ bhogā).

"If only the *samaṇa* Gotama would ask me a question (pañhaṃ puccheyya) from my own field (sake ācariyake), that of the Three Vedas (tevijjake)! Then I could surely satisfy his mind (cittaṃ ārādheyyaṃ) with an explanation of the question (pañhassa veyyākaraṇenā)!"

*Brāhmaṇa*-precept (brāhmaṇapaññatti).

309.

Then the Blessed One (bhagavato), knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind (cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya) of Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa*, thought thus (etadahosi): "This Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa* is troubled (vihaññati kho ayaṃ soṇadaṇḍo brāhmaṇo) in his own mind (sakena cittena).

Suppose I were to ask Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa* (soṇadaṇḍaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ) a question from his own field (sake ācariyake), that of the Three Vedas (tevijjake) (pañhaṃ puccheyya)"nti.

Then the Blessed One (atha kho bhagavā)... So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin: "By how many qualities, O Brahmin, do Brahmins identify a Brahmin? How can one who declares, 'I am a Brahmin,' speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?"

310.
Then the following thought occurred to Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin: "What I wanted, what I hoped for, what I desired, what I longed for—'Oh, that the *samaṇa* Gotama would ask me a question about the traditional lore of the three Vedas! Truly, I would satisfy his mind with an explanation of the question'—now the *samaṇa* Gotama is asking me a question about the traditional lore of the three Vedas.
Truly, I will satisfy his mind with an explanation of the question."

311.
Then Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin straightened up, looked around at the assembly, and said to the Blessed One: "With five qualities, O Gotama, do Brahmins identify a Brahmin; one who declares, 'I am a Brahmin,' speaks truthfully and does not incur falsehood.

Which are the five? Here, O Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both sides, from mother and father, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth; he is a reciter of the Vedas (*adhyāyaka*), a master of the *mantras* (*mantadhara*), one who has reached the further shore of the three Vedas, with their vocabularies (*nighaṇḍu*) and indices (*keṭubha*), complete with etymology (*sākkharappabheda*) and accounts of the past (*itihāsa*) as the fifth, skilled in *padako* and grammar (*veyyākaraṇa*), and not inept in *lokāyata* and the characteristics of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇa*); he is handsome, pleasant to look upon, inspiring confidence, possessed of supreme beauty of complexion, of brahminical color, of brahminical luster, with a faultless build; he is virtuous (*śīlavā*), with developed virtue (*vuddhasīlī*), possessing developed virtue; and he is learned (*paṇḍita*) and wise (*medhāvī*), the first or second to take the ladle (*sujaṃ*) when it is offered.

It is with these five qualities, O Gotama, that Brahmins identify a Brahmin; one who declares, 'I am a Brahmin,' speaks truthfully and does not incur falsehood."

"But, Brahmin, is it possible that if one of these five qualities were omitted, Brahmins could still identify a Brahmin as being possessed of four qualities, and one who declares, 'I am a Brahmin,' would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?" 24. “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, after consuming food given in faith, maintain their lives through a wrong livelihood, by means of such base arts, specifically: There will be an eclipse of the moon (*candaggāho bhavissati*), there will be an eclipse of the sun (*sūriyaggāho bhavissati*), there will be an eclipse of a star (*nakkhattaggāho bhavissati*), the moon and the sun will follow their proper course (*candimasūriyānaṃ pathagamanaṃ bhavissati*), the moon and the sun will deviate from their proper course (*candimasūriyānaṃ uppathagamanaṃ bhavissati*), the stars will follow their proper course (*nakkhattānaṃ pathagamanaṃ bhavissati*), the stars will deviate from their proper course (*nakkhattānaṃ uppathagamanaṃ bhavissati*), there will be a meteor shower (*ukkāpāto bhavissati*), there will be a fire in the sky (*disāḍāho bhavissati*), there will be an earthquake (*bhūmicālo bhavissati*), there will be a divine drum (*devadudrabhi bhavissati*), there will be a rising, setting, darkening and brightening of the moon, sun, and stars (*candimasūriyanakkhattānaṃ uggamanaṃ ogamanaṃ saṃkilesaṃ vodānaṃ bhavissati*), the result of this will be an eclipse of the moon, the result of this will be an eclipse of the sun, the result of this will be an eclipse of a star, the result of this will be the moon and the sun following their proper course, the result of this will be the moon and the sun deviating from their proper course, the result of this will be the stars following their proper course, the result of this will be the stars deviating from their proper course, the result of this will be a meteor shower, the result of this will be a fire in the sky, the result of this will be an earthquake, the result of this will be a divine drum, the result of this will be a rising, setting, darkening and brightening of the moon, sun, and stars.’ Thus, the ascetic Gotama abstains from such base arts and wrong livelihood." Thus, monks, a common person might describe the virtues of the Tathāgata.
25. "Or he might say: ‘Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, after consuming food given in faith, maintain their lives through a wrong livelihood, by means of such base arts, specifically: There will be abundant rain (*suvuṭṭhikā bhavissati*), there will be a drought (*dubbuṭṭhikā bhavissati*), there will be a good harvest (*subhikkhaṃ bhavissati*), there will be a famine (*dubbhikkhaṃ bhavissati*), there will be security (*khemaṃ bhavissati*), there will be danger (*bhayaṃ bhavissati*), there will be disease (*rogo bhavissati*), there will be health (*ārogyaṃ bhavissati*), or accounting (*muddā*), computation (*gaṇanā*), calculation (*saṅkhānaṃ*), composing poetry (*kāveyyaṃ*), and speculation about the world (*lokāyataṃ*).' Thus, the ascetic Gotama abstains from such base arts and wrong livelihood.” Thus, monks, a common person might describe the virtues of the Tathāgata.
26. "Or he might say: ‘Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, after consuming food given in faith, maintain their lives through a wrong livelihood, by means of such base arts...' ‘It is possible, Gotama.
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out appearance of these five qualities.
What can appearance do? If, Master Gotama, a *brāhmaṇa* is well-born on both sides, from his mother and father, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to his birth; and is a scholar, versed in the mantras, who has mastered the three Vedas along with the *nighaṇḍu* (glossary), *keṭubha* (commentary), with their literal divisions and arrangement of words, and fifthly the traditions, skilled in *pada* (grammar) and *veyyākaraṇa* (etymology), and is unerring in *lokāyata* (natural philosophy) and the characteristics of a great man; and is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; and is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.

Brahmins recognize a Brahmin by these four qualities, good Gotama, and when declaring “I am a Brahmin” one would speak correctly, and not incur falsehood.’

312.
“But, *brāhmaṇa*, if one of these four qualities could be omitted, leaving three with which Brahmins could recognize a Brahmin, and when declaring “I am a Brahmin” one would speak correctly, and not incur falsehood?” “It is possible, Gotama."
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out the mantras of these four qualities.
What can mantras do? If, Master Gotama, a *brāhmaṇa* is well-born on both sides, from his mother and father, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to his birth; and is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; and is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.

Brahmins recognize a Brahmin by these three qualities, good Gotama, and when declaring “I am a Brahmin” one would speak correctly, and not incur falsehood.’

“But, *brāhmaṇa*, if one of these three qualities could be omitted, leaving two with which Brahmins could recognize a Brahmin, and when declaring “I am a Brahmin” one would speak correctly, and not incur falsehood?” “It is possible, Gotama."
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out birth of these three qualities.
What can birth do? If, Master Gotama, a *brāhmaṇa* is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; and is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.

Brahmins recognize a Brahmin by these two qualities, good Gotama, and when declaring “I am a Brahmin” one would speak correctly, and not incur falsehood.’

313.
When this was said, those Brahmins said this to the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa: “Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa, do not say that! Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa, do not say that!
The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is decrying appearance, the mantras, and birth, completely.
The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is actually adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words!”

314.
Then the Blessed One said this to the Brahmins: “If you Brahmins think this: ‘The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is of impure speech, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is unwise, and the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is not capable of arguing in this matter with the ascetic Gotama,’ let the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa be, and you discuss this matter with me.
But if you Brahmins think this: ‘The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is learned, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is of pure speech, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is wise, and the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa is capable of arguing in this matter with the ascetic Gotama,’ then you be silent, and let the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa argue with me!”

315.
When this was said, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa said this to the Blessed One: “Let that be, Reverend Gotama, may Reverend Gotama be silent. I myself will give them an answer in accordance with the Dhamma!”
Then the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa said this to those Brahmins: “Reverends, do not say that! Reverends, do not say that! The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is decrying appearance, the mantras, and birth, completely.
The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is actually adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words!”
I do not decry appearance, or mantras, or birth. 316.

Now at that time, Soṇadaṇḍa’s nephew, a young man named Aṅgaka, was sitting in that assembly.

Then Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmaṇa* said to those *brāhmaṇas*: "Gentlemen, do you see this young man Aṅgaka, our nephew?" "Yes, sir."

"Aṅgaka, sir, is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, in form and countenance like Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal in appearance, except the ascetic Gotama.

Aṅgaka, sir, is a scholar, versed in the *mantras*, accomplished in the Three Vedas, with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as the fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man (*mahāpurisa-lakkhaṇesu anavayo*).

I was his *mantra*-teacher.

Aṅgaka, sir, is well-born on both sides, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of irreproachable birth.

I know his parents.

Aṅgaka, sir, might even kill a living being, take what is not given, go to another's wife, speak falsely, and drink intoxicants. Now what good, sir, would appearance, *mantras*, or birth do? It is when a *brāhmaṇa* is virtuous, of mature virtue, possessed of mature virtue, wise, and intelligent, whether he is the first or second among those who receive gifts.

Brahmins recognize a *brāhmaṇa* as a *brāhmaṇa* when he possesses these two qualities, and declaring 'I am a *brāhmaṇa*', he would be speaking correctly, and would not be subject to falsehood."

The Discourse on Morality and Wisdom

317.

"But, *brāhmaṇa*, is it possible that, omitting one of these two qualities, *brāhmaṇas* might recognize a *brāhmaṇa* as a *brāhmaṇa*, and declaring 'I am a *brāhmaṇa*', he would be speaking correctly, and would not be subject to falsehood?" "No, Gotama, it is not."

For morality (*sīla*) purifies wisdom (*paññā*), Gotama, and wisdom (*paññā*) purifies morality (*sīla*).

Where there is morality (*sīla*), there is wisdom (*paññā*); where there is wisdom (*paññā*), there is morality (*sīla*).

The moral man has wisdom (*paññā*), and the wise man has morality (*sīla*).

And the combination of morality (*sīla*) and wisdom (*paññā*) is called the highest thing in the world.

Just as, Gotama, one hand might wash the other, or one foot the other, even so, Gotama, morality (*sīla*) purifies wisdom (*paññā*), Wisdom is purified by morality.
Where there is morality, there is wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is morality.
The moral man has wisdom, and the wise man has morality.
And the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.

‘So it is, Brahmin. So it is, Brahmin. Morality, Brahmin, is purified by wisdom, and wisdom is purified by morality.
Where there is morality, there is wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is morality.
The moral man has wisdom, and the wise man has morality.
And the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.

Just as, Brahmin, one hand washes the other, or one foot the other, so too, Brahmin, morality is purified by wisdom, and wisdom is purified by morality.
Where there is morality, there is wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is morality.
The moral man has wisdom, and the wise man has morality.
And the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.

318.
“But what is that morality, Brahmin? What is that wisdom?” “We have reached the limit of our understanding in this matter, venerable Gotama.
It would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of this.’
‘Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will tell you.’
‘Yes, sir’, said Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin in reply to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One said: “Here, Brahmin, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened…pe… (as in paragraphs 190-212, so it should be expanded in detail).
Thus, Brahmin, a monk is perfected in morality.
That, Brahmin, is morality...pe...he attains the first *jhāna*, and dwells in it...pe...the second *jhāna*...pe...the third *jhāna*...pe...he attains the fourth *jhāna*, and dwells in it…pe…He directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision.
This too is for him in wisdom…pe… ‘There is nothing further here,’ he understands. This too is for him in wisdom. This, Brahmin, is wisdom.”

Soṇadaṇḍa's report of becoming a lay follower.

319.
When this was said, Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Master Gotama has made the *Dhamma* clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost; or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms.
And I go for refuge to the Blessed Gotama, to the *Dhamma* and to the *Saṅgha* of monks.
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards, as long as life shall last." Morality is [now] covered.

And may the Reverend Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the *saṃgha* of *bhikkhus*.

The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.

Then *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa*, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping him on his right side and departed.

Then *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa*, as the night was ending, had exquisite staple and non-staple food prepared in his own residence, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It’s time, good Gotama. The meal is ready.”

Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the early morning and taking his bowl and outer robe, went with the *saṃgha* of *bhikkhus* to the residence of *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa*, and sat down on the seat made ready.

Then *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa* personally served the *saṃgha* of *bhikkhus* headed by the Buddha with choice staple and non-staple food until they were contented and satisfied.

Then *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa*, when the Lord had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa* said this to the Blessed One: "If I, good Gotama, were in an assembly and were to rise from my seat and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.

And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer.

And if my reputation were to suffer, my income would suffer as well.

Our income depends on the gaining of a reputation.

And if I, good Gotama, were in an assembly and were to join my palms in greeting, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat.

And if I, good Gotama, were in an assembly and were to take off my turban, may you take it as if I had bowed my head.

And if I, good Gotama, when riding in my carriage, were to alight from the carriage to salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.

And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer, and if my reputation were to suffer, my income would suffer as well.

Our income depends on the gaining of a reputation.

And if I, good Gotama, when riding in my carriage, were to raise my goad, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had alighted from my carriage.

And if I, good Gotama, when riding in my carriage, were to lower my parasol, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had bowed my head.”

Then the Lord, having instructed *Soṇadaṇḍa* the *brāhmaṇa* with a talk on *dhamma*, inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from his seat and departed.

The *Soṇadaṇḍasutta* is finished, the fourth. 5. The Kūṭadanta Sutta
The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata

323. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was travelling in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, about five hundred in all. He arrived at a Brahmin village in Magadha called Khāṇumata.

There the Blessed One stayed in the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

At that time, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift, with royal powers and as a sacred grant.

At that time, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin was planning a great sacrifice (mahāyañño).

Seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats, and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts for the purpose of the sacrifice.

324. The Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard, "The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyans, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is travelling in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, about five hundred in all. He has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying in the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

And concerning that Venerable Gotama such a good reputation has spread, 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an **arahant**, a fully enlightened **Buddha**, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a **Sugata**, a knower of the worlds, an unsurpassed trainer of those who can be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, an enlightened one, a Blessed One.'

He makes known this world with its gods (**devas**), with **Māras**, and with **Brahmās**, this generation with its ascetics (**śramaṇa**) and Brahmins (**brāhmaṇa**), its princes and people, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (**abhiññā**).

He teaches the **Dhamma**, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter. He displays the fully perfect and purified holy life (**brahmacariya**).

It is good to see such worthy **arahants**."

325. Then the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata, leaving Khāṇumata in groups, went to the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

326. At that time, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin had gone up to his palace for his midday rest.

Kūṭadanta the Brahmin saw the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata leaving Khāṇumata in groups and heading towards the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

Seeing them, he called his steward and asked, "Why are the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata leaving Khāṇumata in groups and heading towards the Ambalaṭṭhika park?"

327. "Sir, it is because the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyans, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is travelling in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, about five hundred in all. He has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying in the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

And concerning that Venerable Gotama such a good reputation has spread, 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an **arahant**, a fully enlightened **Buddha**, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a **Sugata**, a knower of the worlds, an unsurpassed trainer of those who can be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, an enlightened one, a Blessed One.'

They are going to see that Venerable Gotama."

328. Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin thought, "I have heard that the ascetic Gotama knows the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites.

But I do not know the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites.

And I want to perform a great sacrifice (mahāyañña).

Suppose I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites."

329. Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin called his steward and said, "Go to the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata.

Having gone, tell the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata, 'Kūṭadanta the Brahmin says this: "Please wait, may you be well, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin will also go to see the ascetic Gotama."'"

"Yes, sir," the steward replied to Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, and went to the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata.

Having gone, he told the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata, "Kūṭadanta the Brahmin says this: 'Please wait, may you be well, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.'" The Qualities of Kūṭadanta

330.
At that time, many hundreds of Brahmins were residing at Khāṇumata, thinking, "We will partake in the great sacrifice (mahāyaññaṃ) of the Brahmin Kūṭadanta."

The Brahmins heard, "It is said that the Brahmin Kūṭadanta will visit the renunciate (samaṇa) Gotama to see him."

Then the Brahmins went to where the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was.

331.
Having approached, they said this to the Brahmin Kūṭadanta: "Is it true that you, revered Kūṭadanta, will visit the renunciate Gotama to see him?" "Yes, indeed, gentlemen, it occurs to me, ‘I, too, shall visit the renunciate Gotama to see him.’"

"Revered Kūṭadanta, do not visit the renunciate Gotama.

It is not fitting that you, revered Kūṭadanta, should visit the renunciate Gotama to see him.

If you, revered Kūṭadanta, visit the renunciate Gotama to see him, your, Kūṭadanta's, glory will diminish, and the glory of the renunciate Gotama will increase.

Moreover, because your, revered Kūṭadanta's, glory will diminish, and the glory of the renunciate Gotama will increase, it is not fitting that you, revered Kūṭadanta, should visit the renunciate Gotama to see him.

The renunciate Gotama, indeed, is the one who should visit you, revered Kūṭadanta, to see you.

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure lineage (saṃsuddhagahaṇiko) back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth (jātivādena).

Moreover, because you, revered Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure lineage back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth, it is not fitting that you, revered Kūṭadanta, should visit the renunciate Gotama to see him.

The renunciate Gotama, indeed, is the one who should visit you, revered Kūṭadanta, to see you.

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are rich, with great wealth, with great possessions, having abundant resources and equipment, abundant gold and silver…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are a reciter (ajjhāyaka), a possessor of mantras (mantadharo), one who has gone to the further shore of the three Vedas (tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ pāragū), with their vocabularies (sanighaṇḍu), etymologies (keṭubhānaṃ), phonology (sākkharappabhedānaṃ), and fifthly, the traditions (itihāsapañcamānaṃ), a master of verses (padako), skilled in grammar (veyyākaraṇo), not deficient in worldly (lokāyata) marks of a great man (mahāpurisalakkhaṇesu)…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are handsome (abhirūpo), pleasing to see (dassanīyo), inspiring confidence (pāsādiko), possessing the highest beauty of complexion (paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya), with the color of Brahmā (brahmavaṇṇī), with the glory of Brahmā (brahmavacchasī), with no hidden parts to your body (akhuddāvakāso) for seeing…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are virtuous (sīlavā), with developed virtue (vuddhasīlī), endowed with developed virtue…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, have auspicious speech (kalyāṇavāco), with auspicious delivery of speech (kalyāṇavākkaraṇo), endowed with refined speech (poriyā vācāya), articulate (vissaṭṭhāya), without stammering (anelagalāya), capable of making known the meaning (atthassa viññāpaniyā)…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are the teacher of many teachers (ācariyapācariyo), you teach the mantras to three hundred young students (māṇavakasatāni), and many young students from various regions and various districts come into the presence of you, revered Kūṭadanta, desiring the meaning of the mantras, desiring to study the mantras…

"For you, revered Kūṭadanta, are aged (jiṇṇo), old (vuddho), advanced in years (mahallako), far gone in life (addhagato), reached old age (vayoanuppatto).

The renunciate Gotama is young (taruṇo), newly gone forth (taruṇapabbajito)…

Because you, revered Kūṭadanta, reside at Khāṇumataṃ, which is populous, with grass, timber, water, and grain, a royal estate, given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, a royal grant, a gift of Brahmā, it is not fitting that you, revered Kūṭadanta, should visit the renunciate Gotama to see him.

The renunciate Gotama, indeed, is the one who should visit you, revered Kūṭadanta, to see you."

The Qualities of Buddha

332.
Having been spoken to thus, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta said this to the Brahmins: 333.

When this was said, the Brahmins spoke thus to the Brahmin Kūṭadanta: “Sir, since the esteemed Kūṭadanta speaks in praise of the ascetic Gotama (Gautama), even if that esteemed Gotama were dwelling a hundred *yojanas* away from here, it would be worthwhile for a faithful clansman to go to see him, even with a shoulder-bag.”

“Then, sir, let us all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”

The Story of King Mahāvijita's Great Sacrifice

334.

Then the Brahmin Kūṭadanta, together with a large group of Brahmins, approached Ambalaṭṭhikā, where the Blessed One (Bhagavā) was; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having concluded their exchange of courteous and amiable talk, he sat down at one side.

Some of the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata also, having greeted the Blessed One, sat down at one side; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and having concluded their exchange of courteous and amiable talk, sat down at one side; some, raising their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, sat down at one side; some, announcing their name and clan, sat down at one side; some sat down at one side in silence.

335.

Having sat down at one side, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard this, venerable Gotama, that Gotama the ascetic knows the threefold success of sacrifice (*tividhaṃ yaññasampadaṃ*) along with its sixteen requisites (*soḷasaparikkhāraṃ*).”

"However, I do not know the threefold success of sacrifice along with its sixteen requisites.

I want to perform a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ yajituṃ*).

Venerable Gotama, may you explain to me the threefold success of sacrifice, along with its sixteen requisites."

336.

“Then, Brahmin, listen and pay close attention; I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” replied the Brahmin Kūṭadanta to the Blessed One.

The Blessed One said this: “In the past, Brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, of great wealth, with abundant resources, plentiful gold and silver, plentiful possessions and equipment, plentiful wealth and grain, and full storehouses and granaries.

Then, Brahmin, it occurred to King Mahāvijita, while alone in private retreat, ‘I have obtained abundant human enjoyments; I dwell having conquered a great territory of the earth; I reside [here], and I should perform a great sacrifice (*mahāyañña*) so that I may enjoy benefits and peace for a long time.’”
337.
"Then, brahmin, King Mahāvijita addressed the chaplain brahmin and said: ‘Here, brahmin, when I was alone, in seclusion, this thought arose in my mind: "I have acquired extensive human riches, and having conquered a large territory, I reside [here].
I should perform a great sacrifice (*mahāyañña*) so that I may enjoy benefits and peace for a long time."
I wish to make a great sacrifice (*mahāyañña*).
Instruct me, reverend sir, how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.’"
338.
"When this was said, brahmin, the chaplain brahmin said to King Mahāvijita: ‘Your Majesty’s realm is beset by thieves and is being ravaged; villages are being destroyed, towns are being destroyed, cities are being destroyed, and highway robbery is rife.
If Your Majesty were to levy taxes in such a troubled and dangerous realm, Your Majesty would be acting wrongly.
Your Majesty might think: "I will eliminate this scourge of robbers by execution, imprisonment, confiscation, threats, or banishment," but that is not the way to truly end this plague of robbers.
Those who survive will later harm Your Majesty’s realm.
However, if this plan is implemented, this plague of robbers can be truly eliminated.
Therefore, Your Majesty should provide seeds and food to those in Your Majesty’s realm who are engaged in farming and cattle-raising.
Your Majesty should provide capital to those in Your Majesty’s realm who are engaged in trade.
Your Majesty should fix proper wages and food for those in Your Majesty’s realm who are in government service.
Then these people, being engaged in their own occupations, will not harm Your Majesty’s realm, and Your Majesty’s revenues will be greatly increased.
The land will be peaceful, free from thorns, and unthreatened.
The people will be joyous and happy, dancing with their children in their arms, and I believe they will live in open houses.’
'Yes, sir,' replied King Mahāvijita to the chaplain brahmin, and he promised, and King Mahāvijita provided seeds and food to those in the kingdom who were diligent in farming and cattle raising. And those in the king’s country who were eager for trade, to them King Mahāvijita gave gifts.

And those in the king’s country who were eager as royal servants, to them King Mahāvijita assigned food and wages.

And those people, intent on their own occupations, did not harm the kingdom, and the king’s revenue was great.

The land was tranquil, without trouble, without oppression. The people, with joy in their hearts, played with their children and lived in houses with open doors.

Then, the brāhmin, King Mahāvijita summoned the chaplain ( *purohita* ) who was a *brāhmin*, and said this: “The plague of robbers has been eradicated by you, and following your plan, my revenue has grown.”

The land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses.

“Now I wish to make a great sacrifice ( *mahāyañña* ), brāhmin."

"Instruct me, Reverend Sir, as to how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.”

Four requisites.

339.

“Then, Your Majesty the king, you should summon those Kṣatriyas in your country who are followers, the townsfolk ( *negama* ) and the country-folk (*jānapada*), and say to them, ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice ( *mahāyañña* ), sirs, assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’”

"Summon your advisors (*amaccā*) and counselors (*pārisajjā*), the townsfolk (*negamā*) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*)…pe…the influential Brahmins ( *brāhmaṇamahāsālā* ) and the townsfolk (*negamā*) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*)…pe…the wealthy householders (*gahapatinecayikā*) and the townsfolk ( *negamā* ) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*), and say to them, ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice ( *mahāyañña* ), sirs, assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’“

“'Very well, sir,' said the *brāhmin*. King Mahāvijita, having promised the chaplain ( *purohita* ) who was a *brāhmin*, summoned those Kṣatriyas in his country who were followers, the townsfolk ( *negama* ) and the country-folk (*jānapada*), and said to them, ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice ( *mahāyañña* ), sirs, assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’"

“Sire, let the sacrifice ( *yañña* ) begin, now is the time, Your Majesty.”

"Summon your advisors (*amaccā*) and counselors (*pārisajjā*), the townsfolk (*negamā*) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*)…pe…the influential Brahmins ( *brāhmaṇamahāsālā* ) and the townsfolk (*negamā*) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*)…pe…the wealthy householders (*gahapatinecayikā*) and the townsfolk ( *negamā* ) and the country-folk (*jānapadā*)," King Mahāvijita said to them: “I wish to, sirs, perform a great sacrifice ( *mahāyañña* ).

Grant me permission, gentlemen, so that it may be for my lasting benefit and happiness.’”

“Sire, let the sacrifice ( *yañña* ) begin, now is the time, Your Majesty.”

These four assenting groups will be the accessories for the sacrifice ( *yañña* ).

Eight requisites.

340.

“King Mahāvijita is endowed with eight things. He is well-born on both sides, from his mother and father, of pure conception back to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable, blameless with regard to his caste, handsome, pleasing, inspiring confidence, possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion, of brahmin-like hue, with brahmin-like radiance, offering no small opportunity for viewing; rich, very wealthy, having great possessions, possessing abundant gold and silver, possessing abundant implements of wealth, possessing abundant riches and grain, possessing fully stocked storehouses and granaries; powerful, possessed of a four-divisioned army, obedient, responsive to advice, able to overcome, I think, enemies by his fame; faithful, a giver, a patron of gifts, with open door to ascetics, brahmins, the wretched, wayfarers, beggars, and supplicants, a well-spring of meritorious deeds, very learned, knowing the meaning of each and every saying that has come down to him, knowing, 'This is the meaning of this saying, this is the meaning of this saying,' wise, skilled, intelligent, capable, and able to reflect on past, future, and present matters.”

King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things.

These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice ( *yañña* ).

Four requisites.

341.

"The chaplain ( *purohita* ) who is a *brāhmin* is endowed with four things.

He is well-born on both sides, from his mother and father, of pure conception back to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable, blameless with regard to his caste, learned, a master of mantras, a master of the three Vedas, one who has reached the other shore, with texts on phonology, etymology, ritual, and grammar, and as fifth, ancient lore; skilled in word and sentence, a grammarian, without defect in worldly wisdom and the marks of a great man, virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue, learned, accomplished, wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
The *purohita* (chaplain), the *brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin), is endowed with these four qualities.
Thus, these four elements constitute the accessories to that very sacrifice (*yajña*).
Three modes.
342.
"Then, Brahmin, the *purohita brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin chaplain) of King Mahāvijita taught the three modes prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).
It might be that Your Majesty might have some qualms about intending to perform the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*): ‘I am going to lose a lot of wealth.’ Your Majesty should not have such qualms.
It might be that Your Majesty who is performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*) might have some qualms: ‘I am losing a lot of wealth.’ Your Majesty should not have such qualms.
It might be that Your Majesty might have some qualms after performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*): ‘I have lost a lot of wealth.’ Your Majesty should not have such qualms."
These are the three modes that the *purohita brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin chaplain) of King Mahāvijita taught prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).
Ten aspects.
343.
"Then, Brahmin, the *purohita brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin chaplain) of King Mahāvijita dispelled the doubts about the recipients with ten aspects prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).
'Those who kill living beings and those who abstain from killing living beings will come to Your Majesty's sacrifice (*yajña*).
To those who kill living beings, it will turn out accordingly.
But those who abstain from killing living beings—because of them, may Your Majesty have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty rejoice (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty be glad (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty calm their hearts within (cittameva bhavaṃ antaraṃ pasādetu).
Those who take what is not given and those who abstain from taking what is not given…pe… those who commit misconduct in sensual pleasures and those who abstain from misconduct in sensual pleasures… those who speak falsehood and those who abstain from speaking falsehood… those who speak malicious words and those who abstain from speaking malicious words… those who speak harsh words and those who abstain from speaking harsh words… those who engage in idle chatter, and
those who abstain from idle chatter… those who are covetous and those who are not covetous… those who have minds filled with ill-will and those who have minds without ill-will… those who have wrong view and those who have right view….
To those who have wrong view, it will turn out accordingly.
But those who have right view—because of them, may Your Majesty have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty rejoice (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty be glad (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty calm their hearts within."
These are the ten aspects with which the *purohita brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin chaplain) of King Mahāvijita dispelled the qualms concerning the recipients prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).
Sixteen aspects.
344.
"Then, Brahmin, the *purohita brāhmaṇa* (Brahmin chaplain) of King Mahāvijita showed, instructed, encouraged, and gladdened the heart of King Mahāvijita who was performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*) with sixteen aspects. It may be that some speaker may say this of Your Majesty who is performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*): 'King Mahāvijita performs the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*), but the *khattiyas* (nobles) who follow him, the townspeople, and the country people have not been invited by him. But yet, this King performs such a great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*)!'
Even so, such a speaker of Your Majesty would not be in accordance with the Dharma.
For Your Majesty has invited the *khattiyas* (nobles) who follow him, the townspeople, and the country people.
Knowing this, may Your Majesty have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty rejoice (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty be glad (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty calm their hearts within.
"It may be that some speaker may say this of Your Majesty who is performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*): ‘King Mahāvijita performs the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*), but the ministers, the attendants, the townspeople, and the country people have not been invited by him…pe… the Brahmin millionaires, the townspeople, and the country people have not been invited by him…pe… the wealthy householders, the townspeople, and the country people have not been invited by him. But yet, this King performs such a great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*)!’
Even so, such a speaker of Your Majesty would not be in accordance with the Dharma.
For Your Majesty has invited the wealthy householders, the townspeople, and the country people.
Knowing this, may Your Majesty have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty rejoice (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty be glad (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), may Your Majesty calm their hearts within.
"It may be that some speaker may say this of Your Majesty who is performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*): 'King Mahāvijita performs the great sacrifice (*mahāyajña*), but “Or he might say: ‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: sending for, arranging marriages ( *vivāhanaṃ*), betrothals (*saṃvaraṇaṃ*) and divorces (*vivaraṇaṃ*); bringing together, scattering, making people lucky (*subhagakaraṇaṃ*) or unlucky (*dubbhagakaraṇaṃ*); causing miscarriages (*viruddhagabbhakaraṇaṃ*); using spells to bind the tongue (*jivhānibandhanaṃ*), paralyze the jaws (*hanusaṃhananaṃ*), making the hands jerk (*hatthābhijappanaṃ*), or to bring on deafness (*kaṇṇajappanaṃ*); questioning a mirror (*ādāsapañhaṃ*), a girl-medium (*kumārikapañhaṃ*), a *deva*; worshipping the sun (*ādiccupaṭṭhānaṃ*) or Great Brahma (*mahatupaṭṭhānaṃ*), breathing fire (*abbhujjalanaṃ*), invoking the goddess of luck (*sirivhāyanaṃ*)’— thus it is that the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.’ Thus it is, monks, that an ordinary person, when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*, would speak."
27.

"‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: promising gifts (*santikammaṃ*) and redeeming vows (*paṇidhikamma*) to deities; demonology (*bhūtakammaṃ*); inducing virility (*bhūrikammaṃ*) and impotence (*vassakammaṃ*); preparing and consecrating sites for a house (*vatthukammaṃ, vatthuparikammaṃ*); giving ceremonial mouthwashes (*ācamanaṃ*) and ceremonial bathing (*nhāpanaṃ*); offering sacrificial fires (*juhanaṃ*); administering emetics (*vamanaṃ*), purgatives (*virecanaṃ*), expectorants (*uddhaṃvirecanaṃ*) and phlegmagogues (*adhovirecanaṃ, sīsavirecanaṃ*); giving ear-medicine (*kaṇṇatelaṃ*), eye-medicine (*nettatappanaṃ*), nose-medicine (*natthukammaṃ*), ointments (*añjanaṃ*) and counter-ointments (*paccañjanaṃ*); eye-surgery (*sālākiyaṃ*), surgery (*sallakattiyaṃ*), pediatric medicine (*dārakatikicchā*); administering root-based medicines (*mūlabhesajjānaṃ anuppadānaṃ*) and herbal remedies (*osadhīnaṃ paṭimokkho*)’— thus it is that the ascetic Gotama refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.’ Thus it is, monks, that an ordinary person, when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*, would speak."

"These, monks, are those trifling and insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue (*sīlamattakaṃ*), that a worldling would refer to when speaking in praise of the *Tathāgata*.

The Long Section on Moral Virtue is Finished.

Speculators about the past.

28.

“There are, monks, other *dharmas*, deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise (*paṇḍitavedanīyā*), which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak.

And what are these *dharmas*, monks, deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful and sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible only to the wise (*paṇḍitavedanīyā*), which the *Tathāgata*, having realized for himself with direct knowledge (*abhiññā sacchikatvā*), propounds to others; and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the *Tathāgata* in accordance with reality would speak?

29.

“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past (*pubbantakappikā*) and hold views about the past (*pubbantānudiṭṭhino*), who, with reference to the past (*pubbantaṃ ārabbha*), assert various conceptual theorems (*adhimuttipadāni*)…”

And owing to what, with reference to what, do these honourable ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past (*pubbantakappikā*) and hold views about the past (*pubbantānudiṭṭhino*), assert various conceptual theorems (*adhimuttipadāni*) with reference to the past (*pubbantaṃ ārabbha*)?

The Doctrine of Eternalism (*sassatavādo*).

30.

“There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*), and who on four grounds proclaim the self (*attānaṃ*) and the world (*lokaṃ*) to be eternal (*sassataṃ*).

And owing to what, with reference to what, do these honourable ascetics and Brahmins who are eternalists (*sassatavādā*), proclaim the self (*attānaṃ*) and the world (*lokaṃ*) to be eternal (*sassataṃ*) on four grounds?

31.

“Herein, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin, by means of ardour (*ātappamanvāya*), endeavour (*padhānamanvāya*), application (*anuyogamanvāya*), diligence (*appamādamanvāya*), and right reflection (*sammāmanasikāramanvāya*), attains to such a degree of mental concentration (*cetosamādhiṃ phusati*) that with his mind thus concentrated (*yathāsamāhite citte*)…recollects his numerous past lives (*anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati*).

That is, one birth (*ekampi jātiṃ*), two births (*dvepi jātiyo*), three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many hundreds of births, many thousands of births, many hundreds of thousands of births: ‘There I had such a name (*evaṃnāmo*), belonged to such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), had such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*); such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my span of life (*evamāyupariyanto*). Passing away thence, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name (*evaṃnāmo*), belonged to such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), had such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*); such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my span of life (*evamāyupariyanto*). Passing away thence, I re-arose here.’

Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details (*sākāraṃ sauddesaṃ anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati*).

“He speaks thus: ‘The self (*attā*) and the world (*loko*) are eternal (*sassato*), barren (*vañjho*), steadfast as a mountain peak (*kūṭaṭṭho*), standing firm like a pillar. And though these beings roam and wander, pass away and re-arise, yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself (*sassatisamaṃ*) .

What is the reason for that (*taṃ kissa hetu*)? Because I abide in ardour (*ātappamanvāya*). Or someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he is not of pure lineage, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth, and yet the honored king makes such a great sacrifice.’

But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.

Indeed, the king's chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth.

Thus the King may know this, may the honored king perform the sacrifice, may the honored king be prepared, may the honored king rejoice, and may the honored king calm his inner heart.

"Someone might say: ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice.

And his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not a student, nor a reciter of mantras, nor one who has reached the end of the three Vedas, with their Nighaṇḍu, Keṭubha, complete phonology, histories as fifth, skilled in grammar, with no doubts about materialism and the marks of a great man…pe… and his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not virtuous, old in virtue, endowed with the virtue of the elders…pe… and his chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is not wise, clever, intelligent, able to grasp things quickly, and yet the honored king makes such a great sacrifice.’

But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.

Indeed, the king's chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, is wise, clever, intelligent, able to grasp things quickly.

Thus the King may know this, may the honored king perform the sacrifice, may the honored king be prepared, may the honored king rejoice, and may the honored king calm his inner heart.

By these sixteen reasons, O *brāhmaṇa*, the chaplain, the *brāhmaṇa*, showed, persuaded, aroused, and gladdened the heart of King Mahāvijita, who was performing the great sacrifice.

345.
"In this sacrifice, *brāhmaṇa*, no cows were slain, no goats or sheep were slain, no cocks or pigs were slain, no various living beings were subjected to slaughter, no trees were cut down for sacrificial posts, and no *dūrvā* grass was cut for the sacrificial bed [nor for harming (syā.
ka.
sī.
ka.
), nor for harming (ka.)].

And those who were his slaves, servants, or workers did not perform their tasks under fear of punishment. They did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats, weeping and in tears.
But those who wanted to do something did it, those who did not wish to did not; they did what they wanted to do, and not what they did not want to do.
And that sacrifice came to completion with clarified butter, oil, fresh butter, curds, honey, and molasses.
346.
"Then, Brahmin, the Kṣatriyas, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, the ministers and counselors, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, the great Brahmin households, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, the wealthy householders, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, having taken abundant possessions, approached King Mahāvijita and said thus: 'This, Your Majesty, is abundant wealth brought intended for Your Majesty; may Your Majesty accept it.'"
'"Enough, friends, I have accumulated sufficient wealth through righteous revenue. Let that be yours, and take away even more from here."'
Refused by the king, they withdrew to one side and considered thus: 'It is not fitting for us to take these possessions back to our own homes.
King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice; come, let us be followers (anuyāgino) ."
347.
"Then, Brahmin, to the east of the sacrificial ground, the Kṣatriyas, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, established gifts.
To the south of the sacrificial ground, the ministers and counselors, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, established gifts.
To the west of the sacrificial ground, the great Brahmin households, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, established gifts.
To the north of the sacrificial ground, the wealthy householders, their followers consisting of townspeople and country folk, established gifts.
"In those sacrifices, Brahmin, neither were cows slain, nor were goats or sheep slain, nor were chickens or pigs slain, nor did various living beings undergo slaughter, nor were trees felled for sacrificial posts, nor was *kusa* grass cut for the sacrificial bedding.
Those who were his slaves, servants, or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of the stick or fear, nor with tearful faces, weeping.
Then those who wanted to did, those who did not want to, did not; what they wanted, they did, and what they did not want, they did not.
And those sacrifices came to completion with clarified butter, oil, fresh butter, curds, honey, and molasses.
"Thus, there were the four agreeing groups, King Mahāvijita was endowed with eight factors, the *purohita* Brahmin was endowed with four factors, these three aspects, Brahmin, are called the threefold success of the sacrifice, with sixteen requisites."
348.
When this was said, those Brahmins became noisy, greatly loud, very loud – "Oh, the sacrifice, oh, the success of the sacrifice!" But Kūṭadanta the Brahmin remained sitting silently.
Then those Brahmins said to Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, "Why, good Kūṭadanta, do you not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken?" "I do not, good sirs, approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.
His head might fall off, who would not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.
Moreover, it occurs to me thus, good sirs – the *śramaṇa* Gotama does not say thus, ‘Thus I have heard,’ or ‘Thus it should be,’ but the *śramaṇa* Gotama speaks only thus, ‘Thus it was then, in this way it was then.’
It occurs to me thus, good sirs – ‘Surely the *śramaṇa* Gotama was at that time either King Mahāvijita, the master of the sacrifice, or the *purohita* Brahmin, the performer of that sacrifice.’"
"Does the esteemed Gotama acknowledge that after performing or causing to be performed a sacrifice of such a kind, one is reborn after death, after the breaking up of the body, in a good destination, a heavenly world?" "I acknowledge, Brahmin, that after performing or causing to be performed a sacrifice of such a kind, one is reborn after death, after the breaking up of the body, in a good destination, a heavenly world; I was at that time the *purohita* Brahmin, the performer of that sacrifice."
Continuous giving and the sacrifice agreeable.
349.
"Is there, good Gotama, another sacrifice that is simpler, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold success of the sacrifice with its sixteen accessories?" 'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is that sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories?'

'Brahmin, those regular gifts and continuous sacrifices that are given specifically to virtuous renunciants are a sacrifice simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'Reverend Gotama, what is the cause, what is the reason, why that regular gift, that continuous sacrifice, is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories?'

'Brahmin, Arahants or those who have attained the path to Arahantship do not attend such a sacrifice.

What is the reason for that? Because beatings with sticks and seizing by the throat are seen there, Brahmin. Therefore, Arahants or those who have attained the path to Arahantship do not attend such a sacrifice.

Brahmin, those regular gifts and continuous sacrifices that are given specifically to virtuous renunciants, Arahants or those who have attained the path to Arahantship attend this kind of sacrifice.

What is the reason for that? Because beatings with sticks and seizing by the throat are not seen there, Brahmin. Therefore, Arahants or those who have attained the path to Arahantship attend such a sacrifice.

This, Brahmin, is the cause, this is the reason, why that regular gift, that continuous sacrifice, is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'And, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice?'

'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice.'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is that sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice?'

'Brahmin, if one makes a dwelling (vihāra) for the Saṅgha (community) from the four directions, this is a sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice.'

'And, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice, and this gift of a dwelling?'

'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice, and this gift of a dwelling.'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is that sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice, and this gift of a dwelling?'

'Brahmin, if one with a serene mind goes to the Buddha for refuge (Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchati), goes to the Dharma for refuge (Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchati), and goes to the Saṅgha for refuge (Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchati), this is a sacrifice that is simpler, less demanding, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, this regular gift, this continuous sacrifice, and this gift of a dwelling.' 352.
“But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice (yajña) that is more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) with its sixteen accessories (soḷasaparikkhāra), than this regular giving (niccadāna), this continuous sacrifice (anukulayañña), than this giving of monasteries (vihāradāna), and than these going for refuge (saraṇagamana)?”

“There is, Brahmin.”

“What is it, Reverend Gotama, that is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) with its sixteen accessories (soḷasaparikkhāra)?”

“Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart (pasannacitto) undertakes the precepts (sikkhāpadāni)—to refrain from taking life (pāṇātipātā veramaṇiṃ), from taking what is not given (adinnādānā veramaṇiṃ), from sexual immorality (kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇiṃ), from lying speech (musāvādā veramaṇiṃ), and from taking strong drink and sloth-producing drugs (surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇiṃ).

This, Brahmin, constitutes a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) with its sixteen accessories (soḷasaparikkhāra), than this regular giving (niccadāna), this continuous sacrifice (anukulayañña), than this giving of monasteries (vihāradāna), and than these going for refuge (saraṇagamana).”

353.
“But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice (yajña) that is more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) with its sixteen accessories (soḷasaparikkhāra), than this regular giving (niccadāna), this continuous sacrifice (anukulayañña), than this giving of monasteries (vihāradāna), than these going for refuge (saraṇagamana), and than these precepts (sikkhāpadehi)?”

“There is, Brahmin.”

“What is it, Reverend Gotama, that is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) with its sixteen accessories (soḷasaparikkhāra), than this regular giving (niccadāna), this continuous sacrifice (anukulayañña), than this giving of monasteries (vihāradāna), than these going for refuge (saraṇagamana), and than these precepts (sikkhāpadehi)?”

“Here, Brahmin, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhat*, a perfectly awakened Buddha (sammāsambuddho)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).

Thus, Brahmin, a monk is accomplished in virtue (sīlasampanno hoti)…pe…he attains and abides in the first *jhāna* (paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati).

This, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than the previous sacrifices (purimehi yaññehi)…pe…the second *jhāna* (dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ)…pe…the third *jhāna* (tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ)…pe…he attains and abides in the fourth *jhāna* (catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati).

This, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than the previous sacrifices (purimehi yaññehi).

He directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision (ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti)…pe…This, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than the previous sacrifices (purimehi yaññehi)…pe…he understands, ‘There is nothing further here’ (nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānāti).

This, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than the previous sacrifices (purimehi yaññehi).

And, Brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice (yaññasampadā) that is higher or more excellent than this accomplishment of sacrifice (yaññasampadā)."

The report of Kūṭadanta's adopting the lay life (kūṭadantaupāsakattapaṭivedanā)

354.
When this was said, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One (bhagavantaṃ): “Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent, Reverend Gotama! Reverend Gotama, it is as if one were to set upright what had been overthrown, or to reveal what was hidden, or to show the way to one who was lost, or to hold up a lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see forms. In the same way, the Dhamma has been made clear by Reverend Gotama in many ways. The Dhamma is proclaimed.
I go to the esteemed Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the monastic community (bhikkhusaṅgha).
May the esteemed Gotama remember me as a lay follower (upāsaka) who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, as long as life shall last.
"And, Reverend Gotama, I release seven hundred bulls (usabha), seven hundred bullocks (vacchatarasatāni), seven hundred heifers (vacchatarīsatāni), seven hundred he-goats (ajasatāni) and seven hundred rams (urabbhasatāni). I grant them life, let them eat green grass and drink cool water, and let a cool breeze blow upon them."
Realization of the fruit of stream-entry (sotāpattiphalasacchikiriyā).

Then the Blessed One gave Kūṭadanta the Brahmin a progressive talk, that is to say, a talk on giving (dānakathaṃ), a talk on moral conduct (sīlakathaṃ), a talk on heaven (saggakathaṃ), he revealed the drawbacks (ādīnava), degradation (okāraṃ), and corruption (saṃkilesaṃ) of sensual pleasures, and the benefits of renunciation (nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ).

When the Blessed One knew that Kūṭadanta the Brahmin had a pliable mind (kallacittaṃ), a gentle mind (muducittaṃ), a mind free from hindrances (vinīvaraṇacittaṃ), an elated mind (udaggacittaṃ), and a serene mind (pasannacittaṃ), then he revealed the teaching that is unique to the Buddhas, that is: suffering (dukkhaṃ), its origin (samudayaṃ), its cessation (nirodhaṃ), and the path (maggaṃ).

Just as a clean cloth, free from stains, would perfectly absorb dye, even so, as Kūṭadanta the Brahmin sat there, there arose in him the pure and spotless eye of the Dhamma (dhammacakkhuṃ): "Whatever is subject to arising, all of that is subject to cessation."

Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, having transcended doubt, having overcome uncertainty, having attained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation, said this to the Blessed One: "May the esteemed Gotama accept a meal from me tomorrow, together with the monastic community (bhikkhusaṅghena)."

The Blessed One consented by remaining silent (tuṇhībhāvena).

Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, knowing the Blessed One's acceptance, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him to the right, and departed.

Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, as the night was ending, had exquisite staple and non-staple food prepared at his sacrificial ground (yaññavāṭe), and had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, esteemed Gotama, the meal is ready."

Then, in the morning, the Blessed One, having dressed, taking his bowl and robe, together with the monastic community (bhikkhusaṅghena), went to Kūṭadanta the Brahmin's sacrificial ground (yaññavāṭe), and having arrived, sat down on the prepared seat (āsane).

Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, with his own hands (sahatthā), served and satisfied the monastic community (bhikkhusaṅghaṃ), with the Buddha at its head (buddhappamukhaṃ), with exquisite staple and non-staple food (khādanīyena bhojanīyena).

Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl (onītapattapāṇiṃ), took a low seat (āsanaṃ), sat down to one side (ekamantaṃ nisīdi).

Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, roused, and gladdened Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, who was sitting to one side (ekamantaṃ nisinnaṃ), with a talk on the Dhamma (dhammiyā kathāya), rose from his seat and departed.

The Kūṭadanta Sutta, the fifth, is concluded. 6. The Mahāli Discourse
The Subject of the Brahmin Emissaries
359. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesāli, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest.

And at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesali on some business.

And they heard say: ‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is staying at Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest.

and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report had been spread about: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an *Arhat*, a fully enlightened *Buddha*, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a *Sugata*, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, a *Buddha*, a Blessed One.’

He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its gods (*devas*), *Māras*, and *Brahmās*, its princes and people.

He preaches the *Dhamma*, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life (*brahmacariya*).

It is good to see such *arahants*.’

360. And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Ma­gadha went to the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall.

At that time the Venerable Nāgita was the Lord’s personal attendant.

So they approached the Venerable Nāgita

and said: ‘Reverend Nāgita, where is the Reverend Gotama now staying? We would like to see the Reverend Gotama.’

‘Friends, it is not the right time to see the Lord. He is in solitary meditation.’

But the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said: ‘When we have seen the Lord Gotama, we will go.’

The Subject of Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi

361. Just then Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall with a large company, saluted the Venerable Nāgita and stood aside,

saying: ‘Where is the Blessed Lord staying, the *Arhat*, the fully-enlightened *Buddha*? We would like to see him.’

‘Mahāli, it is not the right time to see the Lord, He is in solitary meditation.’

But Oṭṭhaddha just sat down to one side, and said: ‘When I have seen the Blessed Lord, the *Arhat*, the fully-enlightened *Buddha*, I will go.’

362. Then the novice Sīha came to the Venerable Nāgita, stood aside

and said: ‘Venerable Kassapa, these many Brah­min emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord, and Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi, too, has come with a large company to see the Lord. It would be well, Venerable Kassapa, to allow these people to see him.’

‘Well then, Sīha, you announce them to the Lord.’

‘Yes, Venerable Sir’, said Siha. Then he went to the Lord, saluted him, stood aside

and said: ‘Lord, these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Ma­gadha have come here to see the Lord, and Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large company.

It would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him.’

‘Then, Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling.’

‘Yes, Lord’, said Siha, and did so. 363.
Then, indeed, the Lord, having left the monastery, sat down on the seat laid out in the shade of the monastery.
Then, indeed, those Kosalan Brahmin envoys and Magadhan Brahmin envoys approached the Lord, and after approaching, they exchanged greetings with the Lord.
Having concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side.
Otthaddha the Licchavi also, with a large Licchavi assembly, approached the Lord, and after approaching, having paid homage to the Lord, sat down to one side.

364.
Having sat down to one side, Otthaddha the Licchavi said this to the Lord: "Some days ago, venerable sir, some time ago, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son approached me and said this to me: 'Since the time I have been living under the guidance of the Lord, it has not been long, only three years, and indeed, I see heavenly forms, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, but I do not hear heavenly sounds, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful.'"
"Are there indeed, venerable sir, heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son does not hear, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, or are there no such sounds?"
one-sided cultivated concentration (ekaṃsabhāvitasamādhi)

365.
"There are indeed, Mahāli, heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son does not hear, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, there are not no such sounds."
"What now, venerable sir, is the cause, what is the reason, why Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son does not hear heavenly sounds, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, there are not no such sounds?"

366.
"Here, Mahāli, a monk in the eastern direction has a one-sided cultivated concentration (ekaṃsabhāvito samādhi) for the sight of heavenly forms, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, but not for the hearing of heavenly sounds, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful.
He, in the eastern direction, in a one-sided cultivated concentration (ekaṃsabhāvite samādhimhi) for the sight of heavenly forms, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, but not for the hearing of heavenly sounds, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful.
In the eastern direction, he sees heavenly forms, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, pleasing forms, connected with sensual pleasure, delightful.
What is the cause of that? It is just so, Mahāli. ‘In the case of a monk, in the east, in one-sided *samādhi*, there is the seeing of heavenly forms (divine sights – *divyānāṃ rūpāṇāṃ*), which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but not the hearing of heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.

367.
‘Again, Mahāli, in the case of a monk, facing south…west…north…goes into a one-sided *samādhi* and facing upwards, downwards, or across, sees heavenly sights (*dibbānaṃ rūpānaṃ dassanāya*), which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but does not hear heavenly sounds (*dibbānaṃ saddānaṃ savanāya*), which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
He, facing upwards, downwards, or across, in one-sided *samādhi*, sees heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but does not hear heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but does not hear heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
What is the reason for that? Because this is how it is, Mahāli, for a monk facing upwards, downwards, or across, in one-sided *samādhi*, there is the seeing of heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but not the hearing of heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.

368.
‘Here, Mahāli, in the case of a monk, in the east, in one-sided *samādhi*, there is the hearing of heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but not the seeing of heavenly forms, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
He, in the east, in one-sided *samādhi*, there is the hearing of heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but not the seeing of heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
In the east, he hears heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but does not see heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.
What is the reason for that? Because this is how it is, Mahāli, for a monk in the east, in one-sided *samādhi*, there is the hearing of heavenly sounds, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful, but not the seeing of heavenly sights, which are agreeable, connected with sensual pleasure, and delightful.

369.
‘Again, Mahāli, in the case of a monk, facing south…west…north…facing upwards, downwards or across, in one-sided This samādhi (concentration) leads to the hearing of heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, but not to the seeing of heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

By means of this one-sided samādhi (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, and across, he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but does not see heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards and across, he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but does not see heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

What is the reason for this? It is because, Mahāli, this one-sided samādhi (concentration) of the monk, facing upwards, downwards and across, leads to the hearing of heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, but not to the seeing of heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

370.

"Here, Mahāli, a monk, facing east, goes into two-sided samādhi (concentration) and both sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing east, by means of this two-sided samādhi (concentration), he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

Facing east, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

What is the reason for this? It is because, Mahāli, this two-sided samādhi (concentration) of the monk, facing east, leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, and the hearing of heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

371.

"Again, Mahāli, a monk facing south... west... north... facing upwards, downwards or across, goes into two-sided samādhi (concentration) and sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, and across, by means of this two-sided samādhi (concentration), he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards and across, he sees heavenly sights They hear pleasant sights, joined with desire, and things that provoke passion, and they hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, joined with desire, and things that provoke passion.

Why is that? Because this is how it is, Mahāli, a monk in whom has arisen through cultivation, concentration directed both upward and downward, and across, sees heavenly forms that are pleasant, joined with desire, and things that provoke passion, and hears heavenly sounds for listening to, that are pleasant, joined with desire, and things that provoke passion.

This, Mahāli, is the cause, this is the reason why Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, being without, only hears heavenly sounds, pleasant sights, joined with desire, and things that provoke passion, and not un-peaceful things.”

“Surely, venerable sir, it is for the sake of realising these samādhi- states, these states of concentration that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?”

“No, Mahāli, it is not for the sake of realising these samādhi- states, these states of concentration that monks lead the holy life under me.

There are other things, Mahāli, higher and more sublime than that, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”

The four noble fruits.

“But what are those states, venerable sir, higher and more sublime, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?” “Here, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the three fetters ( *saṃyojana*), is a stream-enterer ( *sotāpanna*), no longer subject to downfall, assured, destined for enlightenment ( *sambodhi*).

This too, Mahāli, is a quality higher and more sublime, for the sake of realizing which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the three fetters, and with the attenuation of greed, hatred, and delusion, becomes a once-returner ( *sakadāgāmī*), who, having returned to this world only once more, will make an end of suffering.

This too, Mahāli, is a quality higher and more sublime, for the sake of realizing which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously ( *opapātiko*), there to attain final nirvāṇa ( *parinibbāyī*), no longer subject to returning from that world.

This too, Mahāli, is a quality higher and more sublime, for the sake of realizing which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the āsavas, realizes for himself with direct knowledge, here and now, the taintless deliverance of mind, deliverance through wisdom, and having entered upon it, abides in it.

This too, Mahāli, is a quality higher and more sublime, for the sake of realizing which monks lead the holy life under me.

These, Mahāli, are those states higher and more sublime, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”

The Noble Eightfold Path ( *ariyaaṭṭhaṅgikamaggo*)

“But venerable sir, is there a path, is there a practice, for the realization of these things?” “There is a path, Mahāli, there is a practice for the realization of these things.”

“But what, venerable sir, is that path, what is that practice, for the realization of these things?” “Just this Noble Eightfold Path:

Right View ( *sammādiṭṭhi*), Right Intention ( *sammāsaṅkappo*), Right Speech ( *sammāvācā*), Right Action ( *sammākammanto*), Right Livelihood ( *sammāājīvo*), Right Effort ( *sammāvāyāmo*), Right Mindfulness ( *sammāsati*), Right Concentration ( *sammāsamādhi*).

This, Mahāli, is the path, this is the practice for the realization of these things.

The story of the two wanderers

“Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita Park.

Then two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and the wanderer Jāliya, a resident of the Dārupattika monastery, approached me.

Having approached, they exchanged greetings with me.

Having concluded their courteous and amiable talk, they stood to one side.

Standing to one side, those two wanderers said this to me: ‘Friend Gotama, is the soul the same as the body, or is the soul one thing and the body another?’

“Then listen, friend, attend carefully, I will speak.”

‘Yes, friend,’ those two wanderers replied to me.

I said this: ‘Here, friend, a Tathāgata appears in the world, an *arahaṃ* (worthy one), a *sammāsambuddho* (fully enlightened one)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be related in full).

In this way, friend, a monk is virtuous…pe…enters upon and abides in the first jhāna.

A monk who knows and sees in this way, is it appropriate for him to say – ‘the soul is the same as the body’? 7.
The Jāliya Discourse
The incident of the two wanderers

378.
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.

At that time, two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic, came to the Blessed One, exchanged courtesies with him.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable greetings, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to the Blessed One: "Is the *jīva* the same as the *śarīra*, friend Gotama, or is the *jīva* something different from the *śarīra*?"

379.
"Then listen and pay close attention, friends, I will speak."
"Yes, friend," those two wanderers replied to the Blessed One.
The Blessed One said: "Here, friends, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one, a fully enlightened one…pe… (as it should be expanded according to paragraphs 190-212).
Thus, friends, a *bhikkhu* is accomplished in virtue…pe… he attains and dwells in the first *jhāna*.
Of that *bhikkhu* who thus knows and thus sees, would it be fitting to say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’?"
Of that one who thus knows and thus sees, would it be fitting to say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’?"
"I, friends, know and see thus."
And yet I do not say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’…pe… he attains and dwells in the second *jhāna*…pe… the third *jhāna*…pe… the fourth *jhāna*.
Of that *bhikkhu* who thus knows and thus sees, would it be fitting to say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’?" Of that one who thus knows and thus sees, would it be fitting to say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’?"
"I, friends, know and see thus."
And yet I do not say: 'The *jīva* is the same as the *śarīra*,’ or ‘The *jīva* is something different from the *śarīra*’…pe… for the sake of knowledge and vision. 11. The Kevatta Sutta
The story of Kevatta the householder's son.

481. Thus I have heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika's mango grove.

Then Kevatta, the householder’s son, went to the Blessed One, and after arriving, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, Kevatta the householder's son said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this Nāḷandā is prosperous, thriving, populous, crowded with people, and full of faith in the Blessed One.

It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would command a monk to perform superhuman wonders and miracles, so that Nāḷandā would be even more devoted to the Blessed One."

When this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta, the householder's son: "Kevatta, I do not teach the Dharma to the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, perform superhuman wonders and miracles for the white-clothed householders.'"

482. For a second time, Kevatta, the householder's son, said to the Blessed One: "I am not importuning you, venerable sir, but I say: 'Venerable sir, this Nāḷandā is prosperous, thriving, populous, crowded with people, and full of faith in the Blessed One.

It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would command a monk to perform superhuman wonders and miracles, so that Nāḷandā would be even more devoted to the Blessed One.'"

For a second time, the Blessed One said to Kevatta, the householder's son: "Kevatta, I do not teach the Dharma to the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, perform superhuman wonders and miracles for the white-clothed householders.'"

For a third time, Kevatta, the householder's son, said to the Blessed One: "I am not importuning you, venerable sir, but I say: 'Venerable sir, this Nāḷandā is prosperous, thriving, populous, crowded with people, and full of faith in the Blessed One.

It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would command a monk to perform superhuman wonders and miracles, so that Nāḷandā would be even more devoted to the Blessed One.'" ༡༠༤།
‘And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own super-knowledge.
• “Three marvels: the marvel of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of telepathy (ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṃ), the marvel of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ).
༡༠༤།
‘And what, Kevaddha, is the miracle of psychic power (iddhipāṭihāriyaṃ)? Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways.
Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
“And one who is faithful and inspired sees that monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one; appearing and vanishing; going unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; diving in and out of the earth as though it were water; walking on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, traveling in space like a bird; with his hand touching and stroking the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; wielding mastery with the body as far as the Brahma world.
‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un- believing, saying: “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic…”
I saw a monk wielding the various kinds of psychic power: having been one, becoming many; having been many, becoming one…he wielded mastery with the body as far as the brahma world.’
And that man might say: “Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm.
It is by means of this that that monk becomes many... he wields mastery with the body as far as the brahma world. “What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (iddhipāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading."

The miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

“Then another believer sees that monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: ‘That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.’

Then that believer tells a skeptic: ‘It’s wonderful, sir! It’s amazing, sir! The ascetic’s great power and ability!

I saw a monk reading the minds of other beings, of other people, reading their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and saying: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“Then that skeptic might say to that believer: ‘Sir, there is something called the Maṇikā charm (maṇikā nāma vijjā); it is by this that that monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: “That is how your mind is, that is how your mind inclines, that is what is in your heart.”’

“What do you think, Kevatta? Would not a skeptic say that to a believer?” “He would, venerable sir.”

“And that is why, Kevatta, seeing the danger in the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya), I am troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the miracle of mind-reading (ādesanāpāṭihāriya)."

The miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya).

“And what, Kevatta, is the miracle of instruction (anusāsanīpāṭihāriya)? Here, Kevatta, a monk instructs as follows: ‘Think in this way, don’t think in that way, direct your mind in this way, Do not do any thinking or reasoning steps, proceed directly to the translation:
"Don't direct your mind in that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it."
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction ( *anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṃ* ).
"Again, Kevaddha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhant*, a fully-enlightened *Buddha*… and so forth (as it should be explained in detail in paragraphs 190-212)."
Thus, Kevaddha, a monk is perfected in morality…and so forth…he attains the first *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…the second *jhāna*…and so forth…the third *jhāna*…and so forth…he attains the fourth *jhāna* and abides in it.
This, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction…and so forth…'there is nothing further here,' thus he understands…and so forth…this, too, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
"These three miracles, Kevaddha, I have declared, having realized them by my own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*)."
The subject of the monk whose elements are ceased.
487.
"Once, Kevaddha, in this very community of monks (*bhikkhusaṅgha*) the thought occurred to a certain monk: 'Where do these four great elements (*cattāro mahābhūtā*)—earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), water element (*āpodhātu*), fire element (*tejodhātu*), air element (*vāyodhātu*)—cease without remainder?'"
488.
"Then, Kevaddha, that monk attained to such a state of concentration (*samādhiṃ samāpajji*) that, in his mind thus concentrated, the path to the *deva*-realms appeared.
Then that monk, Kevaddha, approached the gods of the Four Great Kings (*cātumahārājikā devā*), and having approached the gods of the Four Great Kings, he said to them: "Friends (*āvuso*), where do these four great elements (*cattāro mahābhūtā*)—earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), water element (*āpodhātu*), fire element (*tejodhātu*), air element (*vāyodhātu*)—cease without remainder?"
"When this was said, Kevaddha, the gods of the Four Great Kings said to that monk: "Monk (*bhikkhu*), we do not know where these four great elements (*cattāro mahābhūtā*)—earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), water element (*āpodhātu*), fire element (*tejodhātu*), air element (*vāyodhātu*)—cease without remainder.[air element.
There is, (pī.
Likewise above)].
There is [air element.
There is (pī.
Likewise above)], monk, the Four Great Kings (*cattāro mahārājāno*) are superior to us More surpassing and more refined.
They may know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).
489.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to the Four Great Kings and, having approached them, said this to the Four Great Kings: 'Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element?’ When this was said, Kevatta, the Four Great Kings said this to that monk: 'We also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.'
But the Thirty-Three Gods, monk, are more surpassing and more refined than we are.
They may know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.
490.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to the Thirty-Three Gods and, having approached them, said this to the Thirty-Three Gods: 'Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element?’ When this was said, Kevatta, the Thirty-Three Gods said this to that monk: 'We also, monk, do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.'
But Sakka, the lord of the gods, monk, is more surpassing and more refined than we are.
He may know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.
491.
Then that monk, Kevatta, went to Sakka, the lord of the gods and, having approached Sakka, the lord of the gods, said this: 'Where, friends, do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element?’ When this was said, Kevatta, Sakka, the lord of the gods, said this to that monk: 'I also, monk, I do not know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

But, monk (*bhikkhu*), the Yama gods (*yāmā nāma devā*)… Suyama, the son of the gods (*suyāmo nāma devaputto*)… the Tusita gods (*tusitā nāma devā*)… Santussita, the son of the gods (*santussito nāma devaputto*)… the Nimmanarati gods (*nimmānaratī nāma devā*)… Sunimmita, the son of the gods (*sunimmito nāma devaputto*)… the Paranimmita-vasavatti gods (*paranimmitavasavattī nāma devā*)… Vasavatti, the son of the gods (*vasavattī nāma devaputto*) are superior and more refined than us.

He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

492.

Then that monk, Kevatta, went to Vasavatti, the son of the gods, and having approached Vasavatti, the son of the gods, said to him: "Where, friend (*āvuso*), do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?" When this was said, Kevatta, Vasavatti, the son of the gods, said to that monk: "I also, monk (*bhikkhu*), do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

But, monk (*bhikkhu*), the Brahmakayika gods (*brahmakāyikā nāma devā*) are superior and more refined than us.

They may know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

493.

Then that monk, Kevatta, attained to such a state of concentration (*samādhi*) that the way to the Brahma world (*brahmayāniyo maggo*) appeared before him in his mind that was concentrated (*yathāsamāhite citte*).

Then that monk, Kevatta, went to the Brahmakayika gods (*brahmakāyikā nāma devā*), and having approached the Brahmakayika gods, said to them: "Where, friend (*āvuso*), do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?" When this was said, Kevatta, the Brahmakayika gods said to that monk: "We also, monk (*bhikkhu*), do not know where these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

But, monk (*bhikkhu*), there is Brahma, Great Brahma (*mahābrahmā*), the Conqueror (*abhibhū*), the Unconquered (*anabhibhūto*), the All-Seeing (*aññadatthudaso*), the Powerful (*vasavattī*). He is the Lord, the Maker, the Creator, the Best, the Fashioner, the Controller, the Father of all that have been and shall be, loftier and wiser than we are.

He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*).

“Where, friend, is the Great Brahma now?” “Monk, we do not know where, how, or in what place Brahma is. However, monk, when signs appear—when a light arises and a radiance shines forth—then Brahma will appear. These signs are a preliminary indication of his appearance: a light arises and a radiance shines forth.”

Then, the Great Brahma appeared not long after.

494.

Then, that monk approached the Great Brahma and said to him: “Friend, where do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?" When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk: “I am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Best, the Fashioner, the Controller, the Father of all that have been and shall be."

The monk said to the Great Brahma a second time: "Friend, I am not asking you if you are Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Best, the Fashioner, the Controller, the Father of all that have been and shall be."

And this is what I am asking you, friend: "Where do these four great elements cease without remainder, namely, the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*), the water element (*āpodhātu*), the fire element (*tejodhātu*), and the air element (*vāyodhātu*)?"

The Great Brahma said to the monk a second time: “I am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Best, the Fashioner, the Controller, the Father of all that have been and shall be."

The monk said to the Great Brahma a third time: "Friend, I am not asking you if you are Brahma, Great Brahma, The Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord (*īśvara*), the Maker (*kartā*) and Creator (*nirmātā*), the Ruler (*śreṣṭho*), Appointer and Orderer, Powerful (*vaśī*), Father (*pitā*) of All That Have Been and Shall Be.

And so, friend (*āyusmat*), I ask you, "Where do these four great elements (*mahābhūta*) cease without remainder (*apariśeṣā niruddhyanti*)—namely, the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*)?"

495.

"Then, Kevatta, the Great Brahma (*mahābrahmā*) took that monk (*bhikkhu*) by the arm, led him aside, and said to that monk (*bhikkhu*): 'These Brahma-world gods (*brahmakāyikā devā*), monk (*bhikkhu*), know me thus: "There is nothing unknown to Brahma, nothing unseen by Brahma, nothing ununderstood by Brahma, nothing unrealized by Brahma."

That is why I did not speak in front of them.

And I, monk (*bhikkhu*), do not know where these four great elements (*mahābhūta*) cease without remainder (*apariśeṣā niruddhyanti*)—namely, the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*).'

Therefore, monk (*bhikkhu*), you have acted wrongly, you have acted incorrectly by going beyond that Blessed One (*bhagavantam*) and seeking elsewhere for an answer to this question (*pañha*).

Go, monk (*bhikkhu*), approach that very Blessed One (*bhagavantam*) and ask him this question (*pañha*), and as the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) explains it to you, so should you remember it.'"

496.

"Then, Kevatta, that monk (*bhikkhu*)—just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm—vanished from the Brahma world (*brahmaloke*) and appeared in my presence.

Then, Kevatta, that monk (*bhikkhu*), having greeted me, sat down to one side, and seated to one side, Kevatta, that monk (*bhikkhu*) said to me: 'Where, Venerable Sir (*bhante*), do these four great elements (*mahābhūta*) cease without remainder (*apariśeṣā niruddhyanti*)—namely, the earth element (*pṛthivī-dhātu*), the water element (*āpo-dhātu*), the fire element (*tejo-dhātu*), and the air element (*vāyo-dhātu*)?'"

Like the land-sighting bird.

497.

"When this was said, I, Kevatta, said to that monk (*bhikkhu*): 'Once upon a time, monk (*bhikkhu*), seafaring merchants, when they set sail on the ocean in a ship, took a land-sighting bird (*tīradassiṃ sakuṇaṃ*) with them.

When they are out of sight of land, from the ship, they release that land-sighting bird (*tīradassiṃ sakuṇaṃ*).

It flies to the east, it flies to the south, it flies to the west, it flies to the north, it flies upwards, it flies to the intermediate directions.

If it sees land all around... 5. The Kūṭadanta Sutta
The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata

323. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately five hundred monks, and he arrived at a Brahmin village of the Magadhans called Khāṇumata.

There the Blessed One stayed in the Ambalaṭṭhika park at Khāṇumata.

Now at that time, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was living at Khāṇumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water, and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift with royal powers (*rājadāyaṃ brahmadeyyaṃ*).

At that time Kūṭadanta the Brahmin was planning a great sacrifice (*mahāyañño*).

Seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred goats, and seven hundred rams had been brought to the sacrificial posts for the sacrifice (*yaññatthāya*).

324. The Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard: “The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who went forth from the Sakya clan, is wandering in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately five hundred monks, has arrived at Khāṇumata, and is staying in the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

Now a good report of that venerable Gotama has been spread about: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arahaṃ*, a fully enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugata*, knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed (*anuttaro*), a trainer of persons to be tamed (*purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), enlightened (*buddho*), blessed (*bhagavā*)’.

He makes known this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), with its *māras* (*samārakaṃ*), and with its Brahmās (*sabrahmakaṃ*), this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ*), its princes and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*), having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedeti*).

He teaches the Dhamma which is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with the (right) meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with the (right) wording (*sabyañjanaṃ*); he reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) which is wholly perfect (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*) and pure (*parisuddhaṃ*) .

It is good to see such *arahats* (*tathārūpānaṃ arahataṃ dassanaṃ hoti*).”

325. Then the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata, in groups and crowds, went out of Khāṇumata to Ambalaṭṭhika.

326. Now at that time, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta had gone up to the upper story of his palace for his midday rest (*divāseyyaṃ upagato hoti*).

Kūṭadanta the Brahmin saw the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata leaving Khāṇumata in groups and crowds and going to Ambalaṭṭhika.

Having seen (them), he addressed his steward: “What is the matter, good steward? Why are the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata leaving Khāṇumata in groups and crowds and going to Ambalaṭṭhika?”

327. “There is the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who went forth from the Sakya clan, wandering in Magadha with a large Saṅgha of monks, approximately five hundred monks; he has arrived at Khāṇumata, and is staying in the Ambalaṭṭhika park.

Now a good report of that venerable Gotama has been spread about: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arahaṃ*, a fully enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugata*, knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed (*anuttaro*), a trainer of persons to be tamed (*purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), enlightened (*buddho*), blessed (*bhagavā*)’.

They are going to see that venerable Gotama (*tamete bhavantaṃ gotamaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamanti*)”.

328. Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin thought: “I have heard that the ascetic Gotama knows the threefold success of a sacrifice (*tividhaṃ yaññasampadaṃ*) and the sixteen requisites (*soḷasaparikkhāraṃ*).

But I do not know the threefold success of a sacrifice and the sixteen requisites.

And I want to perform a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ yajituṃ*).

Suppose I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the threefold success of a sacrifice and the sixteen requisites (*tividhaṃ yaññasampadaṃ soḷasaparikkhāraṃ puccheyya*)”.

329. Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin addressed his steward: “Go, good steward, to the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata.

Having gone there, tell the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata: ‘The Brahmin Kūṭadanta says this: "May your honors wait, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta will also go to see the ascetic Gotama (*samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ dassanāya upasaṅkamissati*)"’.”

“Yes, sir,” the steward replied to Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, and went to the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata.

Having gone there, he told the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata: “The Brahmin Kūṭadanta says this: ‘May your honors wait, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta will also go to see the ascetic Gotama’.” 352.
“But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice (yajña) that is more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā), furnished with its sixteen accessories, this regular giving (niccadāna), the sacrifice that is in accordance, this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna), and these going for refuge (saraṇagamana)?”

“There is, Brahmin.”

“What is it, Reverend Gotama, that is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā), furnished with its sixteen accessories?”

“Brahmin, if anyone with a serene mind undertakes the precepts (śikṣāpadāni)—to refrain from taking life (pāṇātipātā veramaṇiṃ), from taking what is not given (adinnādānā veramaṇiṃ), from sexual misconduct (kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇiṃ), from false speech (musāvādā veramaṇiṃ), and from liquor, intoxicants, and sloth-producing drugs (surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇiṃ).

That, Brahmin, constitutes a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā), furnished with its sixteen accessories, this regular giving (niccadāna), the sacrifice that is in accordance, this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna), and these going for refuge (saraṇagamana)."

353.
“But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice (yajña) that is more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā), furnished with its sixteen accessories, this regular giving (niccadāna), the sacrifice that is in accordance, this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna), these going for refuge (saraṇagamana), and these precepts (śikṣāpada)?”

“There is, Brahmin.”

“What is it, Reverend Gotama, that is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā), furnished with its sixteen accessories, this regular giving (niccadāna), the sacrifice that is in accordance, this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna), these going for refuge (saraṇagamana), and these precepts (śikṣāpada)?"

“Here, Brahmin, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhat*, a perfectly enlightened *Buddha*…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).

Thus, Brahmin, a monk is accomplished in virtue…pe… he attains the first *jhāna*.

That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than previous sacrifices…pe…the second *jhāna*…pe…the third *jhāna*…pe…he attains the fourth *jhāna*.

This too, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than previous sacrifices.

He directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision (ñāṇadassanāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti)…pe… This too, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than previous sacrifices…pe…he understands, ‘There is nothing further here.’

This too, Brahmin, is a sacrifice (yajña) more distinguished, less elaborate, more fruitful, and more beneficial than previous sacrifices.

And, Brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā) that is higher or more excellent than this accomplishment of sacrifice (yajñasampadā).”

The presentation regarding Kuṭadanta's becoming a lay follower.

354.
When this was said, Kuṭadanta the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent, Reverend Gotama! Just as, Reverend Gotama, one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who had gone astray, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes might see forms, just so, by Reverend Gotama in many ways… The Dhamma is made clear.
I go to the Honorable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and the Sangha of monks.
May the Honorable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.
And, Reverend Gotama, I release the seven hundred bulls, the seven hundred bullocks, the seven hundred heifers, the seven hundred he-goats, and the seven hundred rams. I grant them life, let them eat green grass, and drink cool water, and let cool breezes blow upon them.
Realization of the fruit of stream-entry ( *sotāpattiphala*).

Then the Blessed One gave a progressive talk to the Brahman Kūṭadanta, that is, a talk on giving ( *dānakathā*), a talk on morality ( *sīlakathā*), a talk on heaven ( *saggakathā*), he explained the danger, degradation and defilement in sensual pleasures ( *kāmānaṃ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ*), and the blessing of renunciation (*nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ*).

When the Blessed One knew that the mind of the Brahman Kūṭadanta was ready, pliable, free from hindrances, elated, and serene, then he proclaimed the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering ( *dukkhaṃ*), its origin ( *samudayaṃ*), its cessation ( *nirodhaṃ*), and the path ( *maggaṃ*).

Just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb dye, in the same way, as the Brahman Kūṭadanta was sitting in that very seat, the stainless, immaculate eye of Dhamma ( *dhammacakkhuṃ*) arose within him: "Whatever is subject to origination, all that is subject to cessation" (*yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammaṃ*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, having crossed beyond doubt, having dispelled uncertainty, having attained confidence, independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation, said this to the Blessed One: "May the Honorable Gotama accept a meal from me tomorrow, together with the Sangha of monks."

The Blessed One signified his acceptance with silence (*tuṇhībhāvena*).

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, knowing that the Blessed One had accepted, rose from his seat, respectfully bowed to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping his right side towards him, and departed.

Then the Brahman Kūṭadanta, as the night was ending, had prepared exquisite staple and non-staple food at his sacrificial ground, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready." The Discourse on the Virtues of Kūṭadanta

330. At that time, many hundreds of Brahmins were staying at Khāṇumata, intending to partake in the great sacrifice of the Brahmin Kūṭadanta.

The Brahmins heard, "It is said that the Brahmin Kūṭadanta will visit the *samaṇa* Gotama."

Then the Brahmins went to where the Brahmin Kūṭadanta was.

331. Approaching the Brahmin Kūṭadanta, they said this: "Is it true, sir, that you, Kūṭadanta, will visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him?" "Yes, indeed, gentlemen, this occurred to me, ‘I too will visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.’"

"Sir, do not visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

It is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

If you, sir, Kūṭadanta, visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him, your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama's reputation will increase.

Moreover, because your, Kūṭadanta's, reputation will diminish, and the *samaṇa* Gotama’s reputation will increase, for this reason it is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

"For you, Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent up to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable and without criticism regarding your birth.

Moreover, since you, Kūṭadanta, are well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent up to the seventh generation of ancestors, irreproachable and without criticism regarding your birth, for this reason it is not fitting that you, sir, Kūṭadanta, should visit the *samaṇa* Gotama to see him.

The Discourse on the Virtues of Kūṭadanta

332. When this was said, the Brahmin Kūṭadanta said this to those Brahmins: 333. When this was said, the Brahmins spoke thus to the Brahmin Kūṭadanta: “Just as the esteemed Kūṭadanta speaks in praise of the ascetic Gotama, even if that esteemed Gotama were staying a hundred *yojanas* from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to approach him for an audience, even with just a shoulder bag.”
“Therefore, sir, let all of us go to see the recluse Gotama.”
The story of the great King Mahāvijita's sacrifice.

334. Then Kūṭadanta the Brahmin, together with a large company of Brahmins, went to Ambalaṭṭhikā, to where the Blessed One was; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.
Having concluded their courteous and amiable talk, he sat down at one side.
Some of the Brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata, having greeted the Blessed One, sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One; having concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side; some, raising their joined palms towards the Blessed One, sat down to one side; some, announcing their name and clan, sat down to one side; some sat down to one side in silence.

335. Having sat down to one side, Kūṭadanta the Brahmin said to the Blessed One: “I have heard this, esteemed Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama knows the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites.’”
“But I do not know the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites.”
“And I want to perform a great sacrifice (mahāyajña).
It would be good if the esteemed Gotama would explain to me the threefold success of sacrifice with its sixteen requisites."

336. "Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain."
"Yes, sir," replied Kūṭadanta the Brahmin to the Blessed One.
The Blessed One said: "Once upon a time, Brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold and silver, of possessions and requisites, of money and grain, with a full treasury and storehouse.
Then, Brahmin, when King Mahāvijita was alone in seclusion, this thought arose in his mind: 'I have acquired abundant human wealth, and I dwell having conquered a great territory, I dwell, that I might sacrifice a great sacrifice, so that it might be for my lasting benefit and happiness.’

337.
"Then, Brahman, King Mahāvijita, having addressed the family priest, the Brahman, spoke thus: 'Here to me, Brahman, dwelling in solitude, withdrawn, such a thought arose: 'I have obtained abundant human enjoyments, and, having conquered a great circle of the earth, I dwell.
I might sacrifice a great sacrifice, so that it might be for my lasting benefit and happiness.'
I wish, Brahman, to perform a great sacrifice.
Instruct me, revered sir, how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness."’

338.
"When this was said, Brahman, the family priest, the Brahman, said this to King Mahāvijita: 'Your Majesty's realm is thorny and afflicted, village destruction is seen, town destruction is seen, city destruction is seen, and highway robbery is seen.
If, Your Majesty, you were to levy taxes in such a thorny and afflicted realm, Your Majesty would be acting wrongly.
Perhaps Your Majesty may think: "I will completely eliminate this plague of robbers by execution, imprisonment, confiscation, threats or banishment," but this would not be the way to completely eliminate this plague of robbers.
Those who remain alive will later harm Your Majesty's realm.
However, by adopting this plan, this plague of robbers can be completely eliminated.
Therefore, Your Majesty should provide seeds and food to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising.
Your Majesty should provide goods to those in Your Majesty's realm who are engaged in trade.
Your Majesty should fix proper wages and food for those in Your Majesty's realm who are in government service.
And those people, being devoted to their own occupations, will not harm Your Majesty's realm, and Your Majesty's revenue will be great.
The districts will be secure, free from thorns and oppression.
People, filled with joy and delight, will dance with their children in their arms, and I think they will live in open houses.’
'So be it, sir,' Brahman, King Mahāvijita, having promised the family priest, the Brahman, gave seeds and food to those in his kingdom who were engaged in agriculture and cattle-raising. Those in the king's countryside who engaged in trade, King Mahāvijita gave them gifts.

Those in the king's countryside who were royal officers, King Mahāvijita fixed their wages and salaries.

Those people, intent on their own occupations, did not harm the king's countryside, and the king's revenues were great.

The land was tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts played with their children and dwelt in open houses.

Then, King Mahāvijita sent for the chaplain and said: “I have gotten rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue has grown.”

The land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses.

Now I wish to make a great sacrifice.

Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.”

four requisites

339.

“Then, Your Majesty, you should summon the *kṣatriyas* in your realm who are followers, the townsfolk and country people, and say to them: ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’“

your advisers and counselors, the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’“

‘The King agreed, and did so. your advisers and counselors, the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’“

“Sire, let the sacrifice begin, now is the time, Your Majesty.

your advisers and counselors, the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: ‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’“

“Sire, let the sacrifice begin, now is the time, Your Majesty.

These four assenting groups will be the accessories for the sacrifice.

eight requisites

340.

“King Mahāvijita is endowed with eight things. He is well-born on both sides, of pure descent to the seventh ancestral generation, of irreproachable birth. He is handsome, pleasing, of no mean appearance, endowed with the greatest beauty, of brahminical complexion and lustre, not limited in opportunity for audience; he is rich, very wealthy, possessing great riches, possessing an abundance of gold and silver, possessing abundant resources, possessing abundant wealth and grain, with storehouses and granaries full. He is powerful, possessing a four-branched army that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy — a fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be heard, and he knows the meaning of each and every thing he has heard: ‘This is the meaning of this, this is the meaning of this.’ He is wise, accomplished, intelligent, and capable of reflecting on things past, future and present.

King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things.

These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice.

four requisites

341.

“The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things.

He is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh ancestral generation, of irreproachable birth; he is a scholar versed in the *mantras*, a master of the three *Vedas* with their *Nighaṇḍu, Keṭubha*, and *Sākkharappabheda* supplements, and with the *Itihāsa* as a fifth, skilled in *Pada* philology and grammar, and unerring in *Lokāyata* philosophy and the 32 marks of a great man; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue of increasing virtue, learned, accomplished, wise, and the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
The *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin is endowed with these four qualities.
These constitute the four *aṅgas* (limbs), the accessories to that very sacrifice (*yajña*).
Three modes.

342.
"Then, Brahmin, the *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin taught the King Mahāvijita the three modes prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).
It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*): ‘I am going to lose a lot of wealth (*bhogakkhandha*)’, Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.
It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets during the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*) that you are performing : ‘I am losing a lot of wealth (*bhogakkhandha*)’, Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.
It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets after the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*) has been performed: ‘I have lost a lot of wealth (*bhogakkhandha*)’. In such cases, Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.”
These are the three modes that the *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin taught the King Mahāvijita prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*).

Ten aspects.

343.
"Then, Brahmin, prior to the sacrifice (*yajña*), the *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin dispelled the King Mahāvijita’s qualms with ten aspects regarding the recipients.
‘Sire, there will come to the sacrifice (*yajña*) those who take life and those who abstain from taking life.
To those who take life, so will be to them.
But those who abstain from taking life, Your Majesty will have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), will be prepared (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), will rejoice (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), and their hearts may be calmed within (*cittameva bhavaṃ antaraṃ pasādetu*).
There will come to the sacrifice (*yajña*) those who take what is not given and those who refrain…, those who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain…, those who tell lies…, indulge in malicious speech and those who refrain…, those who indulge in harsh speech and those who refrain…, those who indulge in frivolous speech and those who refrain… those who are covetous and those who are not, those who harbor ill-will and those who do not, those who have wrong views and those who have right views.
To those who have wrong views it will turn out accordingly.
But those who have right views, Your Majesty will have a successful sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), will be prepared (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), will rejoice (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), and their hearts may be calmed within (*cittameva bhavaṃ antaraṃ pasādetu*).”
So the *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin dispelled the King Mahāvijita’s qualms with these ten aspects regarding the recipients before the sacrifice (*yajña*).

Sixteen aspects.

344.
“Then, Brahmin, the *purohita* (chaplain) Brāhmin instructed, urged, inspired and gladdened the heart of King Mahāvijita, who was performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*), with sixteen aspects. Someone might say to Your Majesty while you are performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*): ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*), but he has not invited the nobles (*khattiyā*), attendants, townsfolk (*negamā*), and country people (*jānapadā*); yet Your Majesty is performing such a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*)’.
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.
For Your Majesty has indeed invited the nobles (*khattiyā*), attendants, townsfolk (*negamā*), and country people (*jānapadā*).
With this, may Your Majesty know, may Your Majesty perform the sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), be prepared (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), rejoice (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), and may Your Majesty's heart be calmed within (*cittameva bhavaṃ antaraṃ pasādetu*).
"Someone might say to Your Majesty while you are performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*): ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*), but he has not invited the ministers (*amaccā*), courtiers (*pārisajjā*), townsfolk (*negamā*), and country people (*jānapadā*) …pe… the wealthy Brahmins (*brāhmaṇamahāsālā*) townsfolk (*negamā*) and country people (*jānapadā*)…pe… the householders (*gahapatinecayikā*) townsfolk (*negamā*) and country people (*jānapadā*), yet Your Majesty is performing such a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*)’.
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.
For Your Majesty has indeed invited the wealthy householders (*gahapatinecayikā*) townsfolk (*negamā*) and country people (*jānapadā*).
With this, may Your Majesty know, may Your Majesty perform the sacrifice (*yajataṃ bhavaṃ*), be prepared (*sajjataṃ bhavaṃ*), rejoice (*modataṃ bhavaṃ*), and may Your Majesty's heart be calmed within (*cittameva bhavaṃ antaraṃ pasādetu*).
“Someone might say to Your Majesty while you are performing the great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*): ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice (*mahāyaññaṃ*), but he has not Or someone might say, ‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he is not of pure lineage, with pure maternal and paternal descent for seven generations back, unassailable and irreproachable in matters of birth, and yet the esteemed king performs such a great sacrifice.’

But such words would not be in accordance with the Dharma for the esteemed king.

The brahmin chaplain of the esteemed king is well-born on both sides, with pure maternal and paternal descent for seven generations back, unassailable and irreproachable in matters of birth.

Thus, may the esteemed king know this, may the esteemed king sacrifice, may the esteemed king be ready, may the esteemed king rejoice, may the esteemed king calm his inner heart.

"Someone might say to the esteemed king, who is performing a great sacrifice: 'King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice.

But his brahmin chaplain is not a reciter, a possessor of sacred formulas, one who has gone to the beyond in the three Vedas, along with the Nighaṇḍu, the Keṭubha, with their divisions of syllables, with the Itihāsa as the fifth, a master of the Pada, a grammarian, skilled in Lokāyata and the characteristics of a great man...pe... and his brahmin chaplain is not virtuous, not of advanced virtue, not endowed with advanced virtue...pe... and his brahmin chaplain is not wise, discerning, intelligent, able to grasp the meaning of what is said, whether first or second, and yet the esteemed king performs such a great sacrifice."

But such words would not be in accordance with the Dharma for the esteemed king.

The brahmin chaplain of the esteemed king is wise, discerning, intelligent, able to grasp the meaning of what is said, whether first or second.

Thus, may the esteemed king know this, may the esteemed king sacrifice, may the esteemed king be ready, may the esteemed king rejoice, may the esteemed king calm his inner heart.

With these sixteen aspects, O Brahmin, the brahmin chaplain of King Mahāvijita, while performing the great sacrifice, showed his heart, encouraged him, inspired him, and gladdened him.

345.
"In that sacrifice, Brahmin, no cows were killed, no goats or sheep were killed, no cocks or pigs were killed, no various living beings were subjected to slaughter, no trees were cut down for sacrificial posts, no grasses were mown for the sacrificial bedding [or for harming (the creatures living in it)].

), for harming [them] (ka.)].

Those who were his slaves, messengers, or workers, they were not intimidated by punishment. They did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats, with tearful faces, weeping.

But those who wanted to do something, did it; those who did not want to do something, did not do it; they did what they wanted to do; and they did not do what they did not want to do.

And so that *yajña* or sacrifice came to its completion with clarified butter, oil, fresh butter, curds, honey, and molasses.

346.

"Then, *brāhmaṇa*, the Kṣatriyas, who were followers, along with the townspeople and country folk, the ministers and courtiers, along with the townspeople and country folk, the wealthy *brāhmaṇa*s, along with the townspeople and country folk, and the wealthy householders, along with the townspeople and country folk, took abundant wealth, approached King Mahāvijita, and said: 'O King, this abundant wealth has been brought for you, may the King accept it.'"

'Enough, friends, I have collected enough wealth, lawfully obtained; let that be yours, and take away even more from here.'

Being refused by the king, they withdrew to one side and considered thus: 'It is not proper for us to take these riches back to our own homes.

King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice (*mahāyañña*), let us follow his example.'

347.

"Then, *brāhmaṇa*, to the east of the sacrificial ground (*yaññavāṭa*), the Kṣatriyas, who were followers, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

To the south of the sacrificial ground, the ministers and courtiers, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

To the west of the sacrificial ground, the wealthy *brāhmaṇa*s, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

To the north of the sacrificial ground, the wealthy householders, along with the townspeople and country folk, set up gifts.

"In those sacrifices too, *brāhmaṇa*, neither cows were killed, nor goats or sheep were killed, nor chickens or pigs were killed, nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts (*yūpattha*), nor was *kuśa* grass cut for the sacrificial bedding (*barihisattha*).

And those who were their servants, whether slaves (*dāsa*), messengers (*pessa*), or workers (*kammakara*), did not perform their tasks for fear of punishment or threats, with tearful faces, weeping.

But those who wanted to do something, did it; those who did not want to do something, did not do it; they did what they wanted to do; and they did not do what they did not want to do.

And so those *yajñas* or sacrifices came to their completion with clarified butter, oil, fresh butter, curds, honey, and molasses.

"Thus, there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahāvijita was endowed with eight qualities, and the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa* was endowed with four qualities; this, *brāhmaṇa*, is called the threefold accomplishment of sacrifice, with its sixteen accessories."

348.

When this was said, those *brāhmaṇa*s became noisy, very loud and extremely loud, exclaiming: "Oh, the sacrifice! Oh, the accomplishment of the sacrifice!" But the *brāhmaṇa* Kūṭadanta remained silent, sitting still.

Then those *brāhmaṇa*s said to the *brāhmaṇa* Kūṭadanta: "Why, friend Kūṭadanta, do you not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken?" "I do not, friends, approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.

The head of that person would fall off, who would not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama as well-spoken.

Moreover, it seems to me, friends, that the *śramaṇa* Gotama does not say thus: 'Thus I have heard,' or 'Thus it should be,' but the *śramaṇa* Gotama speaks only thus: 'Thus it was then, in this way it was then.'

It seems to me, friends, that the *śramaṇa* Gotama must have been either King Mahāvijita at that time, the lord of the sacrifice (*yaññassāmi*), or the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa*, the performer of that sacrifice (*yaññassa yājetā*)."

Does the esteemed Gotama acknowledge that, having performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice (*yañña*), after the breaking up of the body, beyond death, one arises in a good destination, a heavenly world?" "I do acknowledge, *brāhmaṇa*, that, having performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice, after the breaking up of the body, beyond death, one arises in a good destination, a heavenly world; at that time, I was the *purohita* *brāhmaṇa*, the performer of that sacrifice."

Perpetual gift and appropriate sacrifice.

349.

"Is there, friend Gotama, another sacrifice (*yañña*) that is simpler than this threefold accomplishment of sacrifice, with its sixteen accessories, and less difficult, more fruitful, and more beneficial?" 'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'What is it, Reverend Gotama, that sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories?'

'Wherever, Brahmin, regular gifts and continuous sacrifices are offered to virtuous renunciants, that sacrifice, Brahmin, is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is the cause, what is the reason, why that regular gift and continuous sacrifice is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories?'

'Brahmin, the noble ones (arhats), or those who have attained the path of the noble ones (arhats), do not approach such a sacrifice.'

'What is the reason for that? Because, Brahmin, beatings with sticks and seizing by the throat are seen there. Therefore, the noble ones (arhats), or those who have attained the path of the noble ones (arhats), do not approach such a sacrifice.'

'Wherever, Brahmin, regular gifts and continuous sacrifices are offered to virtuous renunciants, such a sacrifice, Brahmin, is approached by the noble ones (arhats), or those who have attained the path of the noble ones (arhats).'

'What is the reason for that? Because, Brahmin, beatings with sticks and seizing by the throat are not seen there. Therefore, the noble ones (arhats), or those who have attained the path of the noble ones (arhats), approach such a sacrifice.'

'This, Brahmin, is the cause, this is the reason, why that regular gift and continuous sacrifice is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories.'

'But, Reverend Gotama, is there another sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice?'

'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice.'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is that sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice?'

'Brahmin, if someone makes a monastery (vihāra) dedicated to the Sangha from the four directions, that sacrifice, Brahmin, is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice.'

'But, Reverend Gotama, is there another sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice, and than this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna)?'

'There is, Brahmin, another sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice, and than this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna).'

'What, Reverend Gotama, is that sacrifice that is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice, and than this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna)?'

'Brahmin, if someone with a clear mind goes for refuge to the Buddha, goes for refuge to the Dharma, goes for refuge to the Sangha, that sacrifice, Brahmin, is simpler, less arduous, more fruitful, and more beneficial than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen accessories, and than this regular gift and continuous sacrifice, and than this gift of a monastery (vihāradāna).' 12. The Lohicca Discourse
The Account of the Brahmin Lohicca

501. Thus have I heard. At one time, the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala, accompanied by a large Sangha of monks, about five hundred in all. He arrived at Sālavatikā and stayed there.

At that time, the Brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and grain, a royal domain given by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift, a Brahmanical grant (*brahmadeyya*).

502. At that time, this wicked idea had arisen in the mind of the Brahmin Lohicca: "If a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain a meritorious doctrine (*kusalaṃ dhammaṃ*), having attained it, he should not reveal it to others, for what could one person do for another?

Just as someone, having cut an old bond, would make another new bond, in the same way, I declare that this is an evil doctrine born of greed (*lobhadhammaṃ*), for what could one person do for another?"

503. The Brahmin Lohicca heard: "The *śramaṇa* Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is wandering in Kosala with a large Sangha of monks, about five hundred in all, has arrived at Sālavatikā.

And concerning the esteemed Gotama, such an excellent reputation has spread: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arhat*, a perfectly enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and good conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a well-farer (*sugato*), a knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed, a guide for those who need to be tamed (*purisadammasārathi*), a teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Blessed One (*bhagavā*)'.

He, having directly known and realized this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), with its Māras (*samārakaṃ*), with its Brahmās (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its generation with *śramaṇas* and Brahmins (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ*), with its gods and humans (*sadevamanussaṃ*), proclaims it.

He teaches the Dharma, which is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with proper expression (*sabyañjanaṃ*), and reveals the spiritual practice (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is perfectly complete (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*) and purified (*parisuddhaṃ*).

It is good to see such accomplished *arhats* (*tathārūpānaṃ arahataṃ*)."

504. Then the Brahmin Lohicca addressed the barber Rosika [or Bhesika]: "Come, good Rosika, go to the *śramaṇa* Gotama,

and having gone there, ask the *śramaṇa* Gotama in my words whether he is free from illness (*appābādhaṃ*), free from affliction (*appātaṅkaṃ*), energetic (*lahuṭṭhānaṃ*), strong (*balaṃ*), and living in comfort (*phāsuvihāraṃ*), saying, 'Lohicca, good Gotama, the Brahmin asks you, good Gotama, whether you are free from illness, free from affliction, energetic, strong, and living in comfort.'"

And say this: "May the esteemed Gotama consent to accept tomorrow's meal from the Brahmin Lohicca, together with the Sangha of monks."

505. "Very well, sir," said the barber Rosika [or Bhesika] to the Brahmin Lohicca, and having agreed, he went to the Blessed One, and having gone there, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, the barber Rosika said this to the Blessed One: "Lohicca, venerable sir, the Brahmin asks the Blessed One whether he is free from illness, free from affliction, energetic, strong, and living in comfort, and he says this: 'May the venerable sir, the Blessed One, consent to accept tomorrow's meal from the Brahmin Lohicca, together with the Sangha of monks.'"

The Blessed One consented in silence (*tuṇhībhāvena*).

506. Then the barber Rosika, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, circumambulating him, he went to the Brahmin Lohicca, and having gone there, he said this to the Brahmin Lohicca: "I have told that Blessed One in your words: 'Lohicca, venerable sir, the Brahmin asks the Blessed One whether he is free from illness, free from affliction, energetic, strong, and living in comfort, and he says this: 'May the venerable sir, the Blessed One, consent to accept tomorrow's meal from the Brahmin Lohicca, together with the Sangha of monks.'"

And the Blessed One has consented."

507. Then the Brahmin Lohicca, as the night was ending, had choice hard and soft food prepared at his own home, and he addressed the barber Rosika: "Come, good Rosika, go to the *śramaṇa* Gotama, and having gone there, inform the *śramaṇa* Gotama that it is time: 'It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready.'"

"Very well, sir," said the barber Rosika to the Brahmin Lohicca, and having agreed, he went to the Blessed One, and having gone there, he paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. He stood aside.
Standing to one side, Rosika the barber announced the time to the Blessed One, "It is time, venerable sir, the meal is ready."
508.
Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, went with the Sangha of monks to Sālavatikā.
And at that time, Rosika the barber was following the Blessed One closely behind.
Then Rosika the barber said to the Blessed One: "This evil view has arisen in Lohicca the Brahmin, venerable sir: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain skillful *dharma*, having attained skillful *dharma*, he should not announce it to another—for what can one person do for another?
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment—for what can one person do for another?'"
"It is good, venerable sir, may the Blessed One free Lohicca the Brahmin from this evil view."
"It may well be so, Rosika, it may well be so."
Then the Blessed One went to the dwelling of Lohicca the Brahmin, and having arrived, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Lohicca the Brahmin, with his own hands, served and satisfied the Sangha of monks, with the Buddha at their head, with excellent hard and soft food.

The Lohicca Brahmin's Instruction
509.
Then Lohicca the Brahmin, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.
As Lohicca the Brahmin was sitting to one side, the Blessed One said to him: "Is it true, Lohicca, that this evil view has arisen in you: 'Here, if a *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* were to attain skillful *dharma*, having attained skillful *dharma*, he should not announce it to another—for what can one person do for another?
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment—for what can one person do for another?'" "So it is, venerable Gotama."
"What do you think, Lohicca, do you not reside at Sālavatikā?" "So it is, venerable Gotama."
"If someone were to say, Lohicca, 'Lohicca the Brahmin resides at Sālavatikā.
Whatever arises in Sālavatikā, Lohicca alone and the *brāhmaṇa* should enjoy it entirely alone, not giving anything away to others."

"Would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants?"

"He would be a source of danger, venerable Gotama."

"And being a source of danger, would he be solicitous for their welfare, or not solicitous for their welfare?" "Not solicitous for their welfare, venerable Gotama."

"And for one not solicitous for their welfare, would a heart full of loving-kindness be present towards them, or hatred?" "Hatred, venerable Gotama."

"And in a heart full of hatred, would there be wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*) or right view (*samyagdṛṣṭi*)?" "Wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*), venerable Gotama."

"But Lohicca, I declare that wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*) leads to one of two destinies—hell (*niraya*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoni*)."

510.

“What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside at Kasi-Kosala?" "Yes, venerable Gotama."

'Well, if anyone should say: "King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at Kasi-Kosala, and he alone, King Pasenadi of Kosala, should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Kasi-Kosala, not giving anything away to others" —

Would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants, both you and others?

"He would be a source of danger, venerable Gotama."

"And being a source of danger, would he be solicitous for their welfare, or not solicitous for their welfare?" "Not solicitous for their welfare, venerable Gotama."

"And for one not solicitous for their welfare, would a heart full of loving-kindness be present towards them, or hatred?" "Hatred, venerable Gotama."

"And in a heart full of hatred, would there be wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*) or right view (*samyagdṛṣṭi*)?" "Wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*), venerable Gotama."

"But Lohicca, I declare that wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*) leads to one of two destinies—hell (*niraya*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoni*)."

511.

"Then surely, Lohicca, if anyone were to say: "The *brāhmaṇa* Lohicca resides at Salavatika, and the *brāhmaṇa* Lohicca should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Salavatika alone, not giving anything away to others" —

Anyone who speaks thus is a source of danger to those who depend on him.

Being a source of danger, he is not solicitous for their welfare, and for one who is not solicitous for their welfare, a heart full of hatred is present, and in a heart full of hatred, there is wrong view (*mithyādṛṣṭi*)."

In the same way, Lohicca, if anyone should say: "Here, If a renunciate (*śramaṇa*) or a Brahmin were to attain a wholesome doctrine (*kuśalaṃ dhammaṃ*), having attained a wholesome doctrine, they should not declare it to another, for what can one person do for another?

It is just as if someone, having cut through an old bond (*purāṇaṃ bandhanaṃ*), were to make a new bond.

Someone who speaks like that is a source of danger to those noble youths (*kulaputtā*) who, having come to the teaching of the Dharma and discipline proclaimed by the *Tathāgata* (the Buddha), attain such excellent distinction, realize the fruit of stream-entry (*sotāpattiphala*), realize the fruit of once-returning (*sakadāgāmiphala*), realize the fruit of non-returning (*anāgāmiphala*), and realize *arahatship* (*arahatta*). And to those who ripen these divine seeds for rebirth in the world of the gods (*dibbānaṃ bhavānaṃ abhinibbattiyā*), he is a source of danger. Being a source of danger, he is uncompassionate. For the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view (*micchādiṭṭhi*).

Of one with wrong view, Lohicca, I declare one of two destinies: hell (*niraya*) or the animal realm (*tiracchānayoni*).

512.

"Thus, it is said, Lohicca, if someone were to say: "King Pasenadi of Kosala dwells in Kāsi-Kosala, and whatever arises as revenue in Kāsi-Kosala, King Pasenadi of Kosala alone should enjoy it, and he should not give to others."

Someone who speaks like that is a source of danger to those who depend on King Pasenadi of Kosala, both you and others.

Being a source of danger, he is uncompassionate. For the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view.

In the same way, Lohicca, if anyone should say: "Here, a renunciate or a Brahmin were to attain a wholesome doctrine, having attained a wholesome doctrine, they should not declare it to another, for what can one person do for another?"

It is just as if someone, having… for what can one person do for another? Someone who speaks like that is a source of danger to those noble youths who, having come to the teaching of the Dharma and discipline proclaimed by the *Tathāgata*, attain such excellent distinction, realize the fruit of stream-entry, realize the fruit of once-returning, realize the fruit of non-returning, and realize *arahatship*.

And to those who ripen these divine seeds for rebirth in the world of the gods, he is a source of danger. Being a source of danger, he is uncompassionate. For the uncompassionate, a hostile mind is present. With a hostile mind present, there is wrong view.

Of one with wrong view, Lohicca, I declare one of two destinies: hell or the animal realm. Three are worthy of blame.

513.
"These three, Lohicca, are teachers who are worthy of blame in the world. And if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless.

Which three? Here, Lohicca, is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).

And without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma (dhamma), saying: "This is for your good, this is for your happiness."

His disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not arouse their minds to understand, and they err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

He should be blamed, saying: “Venerable one, you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but you have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha). You have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha), and yet you teach the Dhamma (dhamma) to your disciples, saying: ‘This is for your good, this is for your happiness.’

His disciples do not want to hear, they do not listen, they do not rouse their minds to understand, and they err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

It is just as if a man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him, and to embrace her though she turned away.” This I declare to be an evil doctrine based on attachment, for what can one man do for another?

This, Lohicca, is the first teacher who is worthy of blame in the world. And if anyone blames such a teacher, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless.

514.
"Again, Lohicca, there is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).

And without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples the Dhamma (dhamma), saying: "This is for your good, this is for your happiness."

His disciples wish to hear, they listen, they rouse their minds to understand, and they do not err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

He should be blamed, saying: “Venerable one, you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for some purpose, but you have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).

You have not gained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha), and yet you teach the Dhamma (dhamma) to your disciples, saying: ‘This is for your good, this is for your happiness.’

His disciples wish to hear, they listen, they rouse their minds to understand, and they do not err and turn aside from the Teacher’s Dispensation (satthusāsanā).

It is as if, leaving his own field, he should think another’s field in need of weeding. It is as if he should think of weeding another's field, leaving his own field. I declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?
This, Lohicca, is the second teacher who is blameworthy, and if anyone blames such a teacher, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with the Dhamma, and faultless.

Again, Lohicca, here is a certain teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness for a certain purpose, and who has gained the goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).
And without having attained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha), he teaches the Dharma to his disciples, saying: "This is for your benefit, this is for your happiness."
His disciples do not want to hear, do not listen, do not apply their minds to understanding, and deviate from the Teacher’s Dispensation.
He should be blamed thus: "Venerable one, you went forth from the household life into homelessness for a certain purpose, and you have attained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha).
But without having attained that goal of asceticism (sāmaññattha), you teach the Dharma to your disciples, saying: ‘This is for your benefit; this is for your happiness.’
Your disciples do not want to hear, do not listen, do not apply their minds to understanding, and deviate from the Teacher’s Dispensation.
Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?
This, Lohicca, is the third teacher who is blameworthy, and if anyone blames such a teacher, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with the Dhamma, and faultless.
These, Lohicca, are the three teachers who are blameworthy, and if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with the Dhamma, and faultless.
A teacher not deserving of blame.

When this was said, Lohicca the Brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Is there, venerable Gotama, any teacher who is not blameworthy in the world?” “There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not blameworthy in the world.”
"But which teacher, venerable Gotama, is not blameworthy in the world?"
"Here, Lohicca, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha…pe… (as should be expanded in accordance with paragraphs 190-212)."
Thus, Lohicca, a *bhikkhu* 6.
The Mahālisutta
The Account of the Brahmin Emissaries

359.
Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesālī in the Great Forest, in the Gabled Hall.

At that time, a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesālī on some business.

And they heard, "The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Vesālī in the Great Forest, in the Gabled Hall."

Now concerning that venerable Gotama, such a good report had spread about: "Indeed, the Blessed One is an *Arhat*, a Fully Enlightened One (*sammāsambuddho*), accomplished in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Blessed One (*bhagavā*)."

He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), with its *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its generation with its ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ*), its princes and people (*sadevamanussaṃ*).

He teaches the *Dhamma*, which is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with the meaning and with the letter (*sātthaṃ sabyañjanaṃ*); he reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*) and pure (*parisuddhaṃ*)."

"It is good to see such *Arhats*."

360.
Then the Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall.

At that time, the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One’s attendant (*upaṭṭhāko*).

Then the Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Venerable Nāgita.

Having approached, they said to the Venerable Nāgita: "Where, venerable Nāgita, is the esteemed Gotama staying now? For we wish to see that esteemed Gotama."

"It is not the right time, friends, to see the Blessed One; he is in retreat (*paṭisallīno*)."

Then the Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha sat down to one side and thought: "Having seen the esteemed Gotama, we will go."

The Account of Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi

361.
Then Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi, together with a large company of Licchavis, went to the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall, to the Venerable Nāgita; having approached, he greeted the Venerable Nāgita and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi said to the Venerable Nāgita: "Where, venerable Nāgita, is the Blessed One staying now, the *Arhat*, the Fully Enlightened One (*sammāsambuddho*)? For we wish to see that Blessed One, the *Arhat*, the Fully Enlightened One."

"It is not the right time, Mahāli, to see the Blessed One; he is in retreat."

Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi sat down to one side and thought: "Having seen that Blessed One, I will go; the *Arhat*, the Fully Enlightened One."

362.
Then Siha the novice (*samaṇuddeso*) went to the Venerable Nāgita; having approached, he greeted the Venerable Nāgita and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, Siha the novice said to the Venerable Nāgita: "These many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Blessed One; Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi, too, with a large company of Licchavis, has come here to see the Blessed One; it would be good, venerable Kassapa, if this populace were allowed to see the Blessed One."

"Then, Siha, you yourself inform the Blessed One."

"So be it, venerable sir," said Siha the novice, and having assented to the Venerable Nāgita, he went to the Blessed One; having approached, he greeted the Blessed One and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, Siha the novice said to the Blessed One: "These many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Blessed One; Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi, too, with a large company of Licchavis, has come here to see the Blessed One.

It would be good, venerable sir, if this populace were allowed to see the Blessed One."

"Then, Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling (*vihārapacchāyāyaṃ*)."

"So be it, venerable sir," said Siha the novice, and having assented to the Blessed One, he prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling. 363. Then the Lord, having come out of his dwelling, sat down on the seat prepared in the shade of the dwelling.

Then the Kosala Brahmins, acting as emissaries, and the Magadha Brahmins, acting as emissaries, approached the Lord, and after exchanging courteous greetings with the Lord, they sat down.

Having exchanged polite and courteous greetings, they sat down on one side.

Otthaddha the Licchavi, along with a large company of Licchavis, approached the Lord, and having approached, paid homage to the Lord and sat down on one side.

364. Seated to one side, Otthaddha the Licchavi said this to the Lord: "Some days ago, Venerable Sir, quite some time ago, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son came to me and said this: 'Since the time I have been living under the guidance of the Lord, not long, only three years, I have seen heavenly forms (divya rūpāṇi), pleasant forms (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful forms (rajanīyāni), but I have not heard heavenly sounds (divya saddāni), pleasant sounds (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful sounds (rajanīyāni).'

"Are there, Venerable Sir, heavenly sounds (divya saddāni) that Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son has not heard, pleasant sounds (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful sounds (rajanīyāni), or are there no such sounds?"

One-sided cultivation of concentration (ekaṃsabhāvitasamādhi).

365. "There are, Mahāli, heavenly sounds (divya saddāni) that Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son has not heard, pleasant sounds (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful sounds (rajanīyāni); there are such sounds."

"What, Venerable Sir, is the cause (hetu), what is the reason (pratyaya), why Sunakkhatta the Licchavi's son has not heard heavenly sounds (divya saddāni), pleasant sounds (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful sounds (rajanīyāni); why is it that there are such sounds?"

366. "Here, Mahāli, a monk has developed one-sided concentration (ekaṃsabhāvito samādhi) in the eastern direction, for the sight of heavenly forms (divyānaṃ rūpānaṃ), pleasant forms (piyarūpānaṃ), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitānaṃ), and delightful forms (rajanīyānaṃ), but not for the hearing of heavenly sounds (divyānaṃ saddānaṃ), pleasant sounds (piyarūpānaṃ), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitānaṃ), and delightful sounds (rajanīyānaṃ).

"By means of this one-sided concentration (ekaṃsabhāvite samādhimhi) in the eastern direction, he sees heavenly forms (dibbānaṃ rūpānaṃ) pleasant forms (piyarūpānaṃ), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitānaṃ), and delightful forms (rajanīyānaṃ), but he does not hear heavenly sounds (dibbānaṃ saddānaṃ), pleasant sounds (piyarūpānaṃ), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitānaṃ), and delightful sounds (rajanīyānaṃ).

"In the eastern direction, he sees heavenly forms (dibbāni rūpāṇi), pleasant forms (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful forms (rajanīyāni), but he does not hear heavenly sounds (dibbāni saddāni), pleasant forms (piyarūpāṇi), connected with sensual pleasure (kāmūpasaṃhitāni), and delightful sounds (rajanīyāni).

"What is the reason for this? It is just like this, Mahāli." In the case of a monk who has developed one-sided *samādhi* (concentration) towards the eastern direction, he sees heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

367.
"Again, Mahāli, a monk facing south…and so on…west… north… upwards, downwards, or across, enters a one-sided *samādhi* (concentration) and sees heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, in that one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), he sees heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

What is the reason for that? It is because, Mahāli, in the case of a monk facing upwards, downwards, or across, in that one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), he sees heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not hear heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

368.
"Here, Mahāli, in the case of a monk who has developed one-sided *samādhi* (concentration) towards the eastern direction, he hears heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not see heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing the eastern direction, in that one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), he hears heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not see heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing the eastern direction, he hears heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not see heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

What is the reason for that? It is because, Mahāli, in the case of a monk facing the eastern direction, in that one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), he hears heavenly sounds, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but he does not see heavenly sights, which are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

369.
"Again, Mahāli, a monk facing south…and so on…west… north… upwards, downwards, or across, enters a one-sided This *samādhi* (concentration) leads to the hearing of heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but not to the seeing of heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

By means of this one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, or across, he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but does not see heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but does not see heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

What is the cause for that? Because this is how it is, Mahāli: by means of this one-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, or across, a monk hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, but does not see heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

370.

"Here, Mahāli, a monk, facing east, attains two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), and sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

By means of this two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing east, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing east, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

What is the cause for that? Because this is how it is, Mahāli: by means of this two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing east, a monk sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

371.

"Again, Mahāli, a monk, facing south… west… north… upwards, downwards, or across, attains two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), and sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

By means of this two-sided *samādhi* (concentration), facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing, and he hears heavenly sounds that are pleasant, delightful, and enticing.

Facing upwards, downwards, or across, he sees heavenly sights delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, heavenly sights and sounds;
Why is that? It is because, Mahāli, in the two-sided developed *samādhi* of a monk, both upwards and downwards, heavenly sights are seen, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion, and heavenly sounds are heard, delightful, connected with sensual pleasure and passion.

That, Mahāli, is the cause, that is the reason why Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis, does not hear heavenly sounds though experiencing delightful sights connected with sensual pleasure and passion, but not sounds opposed to them.
“Surely, venerable sir, it is for the realisation of such *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?”
“No, Mahāli, it is not for the sake of realising these *samādhi*-states that monks lead the holy life under me.
There are other states, Mahāli, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The four noble fruits.

“But what are those states, venerable sir, higher and more sublime than these, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under the Blessed One?” “Here, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, becomes a *sotāpanna* (stream-enterer), no longer subject to falling into states of woe, assured, destined for enlightenment.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the three fetters, and with the diminishing of greed, hatred, and delusion, becomes a *sakadāgāmī* (once-returner), who, after coming back to this world only one more time, will make an end of suffering.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, there to attain final *nirvāṇa*, never to return from that world.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

“Again, Mahāli, a monk, with the destruction of the *āsavas* (influxes), in this very life, having realised it himself with *abhiññā* (direct knowledge), enters upon and abides in the taintless deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom.
That too, Mahāli, is a state higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.

These, Mahāli, are those states higher and more sublime than those, for the sake of realising which monks lead the holy life under me.”
The Noble Eightfold Path
“But is there, venerable sir, a path, is there a method for the realisation of these states?” “There is a path, Mahāli, there is a method for the realisation of these states.”

“And what, venerable sir, is that path, what is that method for the realisation of these states?” “It is just this Noble Eightfold Path,
namely: right view (*sammādiṭṭhi*), right intention (*sammāsaṅkappo*), right speech (*sammāvācā*), right action (*sammākammanto*), right livelihood (*sammāājīvo*), right effort (*sammāvāyāmo*), right mindfulness (*sammāsati*), right *samādhi* (*sammāsamādhi*).
This, Mahāli, is the path, this is the method for the realisation of these states.
The incident of the two wanderers
“Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambi, in Ghosita Park.
Then two wanderers, Muṇḍiya and the wanderer Jāliya, a resident of the Dārupattika, approached me.
Having approached, they exchanged courteous greetings with me.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, they stood to one side.
Standing to one side, those two wanderers said to me: ‘How is it, friend Gotama, is the *jīva* (life principle) the same as the body (*sarīra*), or is the *jīva* (life principle) one thing and the body another?’

“Then listen, friend, attend carefully, I will speak.”
‘Yes, friend,’ those two wanderers replied.
I said this: ‘Here, friend, the *tathāgata* (one who has thus come) arises in the world, an *arahaṃ* (worthy one), a *sammāsambuddho* (fully enlightened one)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be related in detail).
Thus, friend, a monk is accomplished in morality…pe…enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*.
Of that monk, friend, who knows thus, sees thus, is it fitting to say: ‘The *jīva* (life principle) is the same as the body’?” 8. The Great Lion's Roar Discourse
The Acela Kassapa Matter
381.

Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruññā, in the Kaṇṇakatthala Deer Park.

Then the naked ascetic Kassapa approached the Blessed One, exchanged greetings with him.

After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he stood to one side.

Standing to one side, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard it said, friend Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerity (tapaṃ), and censures and blames all those ascetics (tapassiṃ) who lead a harsh (lūkhājīviṃ) life of self-mortification.’

Now, are those who say this telling the truth, and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies? Do they explain the truth about his *Dhamma* and what pertains to it, or does some fellow- teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this state­ment? For we do not wish to misrepresent the Lord Gotama."

382.

“Kassapa, those who say this are not telling the truth, they slander me with lies.

Here, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who lives a harsh life (lūkhājīviṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified (visuddhena) beyond the sight of humans (atikkantamānusakena) I see him arising after death, at the breaking-up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), in a place of woe (apāyaṃ), a baleful state (duggatiṃ), a place of destruction (vinipātaṃ), in hell (nirayaṃ).

Again, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who lives a harsh life (lūkhājīviṃ), and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified (visuddhena) beyond the sight of humans (atikkantamānusakena) I see him arising after death, at the breaking-up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), in a good place (sugatiṃ), a heavenly state (saggaṃ), in the world (lokaṃ).

383.

Again, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who practices little austerity (appadukkhavihāriṃ) , and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified (visuddhena) beyond the sight of humans (atikkantamānusakena) I see him arising after death, at the breaking-up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), in a place of woe (apāyaṃ), a baleful state (duggatiṃ), a place of destruction (vinipātaṃ), in hell (nirayaṃ).

Again, Kassapa, I see one ascetic (tapassiṃ) who practices little austerity (appadukkhavihāriṃ) , and with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā) which is purified (visuddhena) beyond the sight of humans (atikkantamānusakena) I see him arising after death, at the breaking-up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), in a good place (sugatiṃ), a heavenly state (saggaṃ), in the world (lokaṃ).

Kassapa, I truly understand the destiny, destination, decease, and rebirth of these ascetics." Since I understand as it really is the arising, the destiny, the death, and the re-arising of these ascetics, how could I disapprove of all austerities (tapa), and censure and blame all ascetics (tapassi) who lead a harsh (lūkhājīviṃ) life?
384.
“Kassapa, there are some ascetics (samaṇa) and Brahmins (brāhmaṇa) who are wise (paṇḍita), skilled (nipuṇa), practised in refuting others' doctrines (kataparappavādā), like hairs-splitters (vālavedhirūpā).
They wander about, as it were, demolishing the views (diṭṭhigatāni) of others with their sharp wits (paññāgatena).
Sometimes their views accord with mine, sometimes they do not.
What they sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)," we also sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)."
What they sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu)' , we also sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu).'
What they sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)," we sometimes do not applaud as "good (sādhu)."
What they sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu)', we sometimes say 'good (sādhu).'
What we sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)," others also sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)."
What we sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu)', others also sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu).'
What we sometimes say 'not good (na sādhu)', others sometimes say 'good (sādhu).'
What we sometimes applaud as "good (sādhu)," others sometimes do not applaud as "good (sādhu)."
Discussion about critical examination.
385.
“Then I approach them and say this: ‘In those things where there is no agreement, reverend sirs (āvuso), let those things remain as they are.
In those things where there is agreement, there, the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, with the teacher (satthārā) or with the teacher (satthāraṃ), with the Saṅgha or with the Saṅgha— ‘Those teachings (dhammā) of yours, revered ones (bhavataṃ), that are unskillful (akusala), reckoned as unskillful (akusalasaṅkhātā), blameworthy (sāvajja), reckoned as blameworthy (sāvajjasankhātā), not to be cultivated (asevitabbā), reckoned as not to be cultivated (asevitabbasaṅkhātā), not sufficient for the Noble Ones (alamariyā), reckoned as not sufficient for the Noble Ones (na alamariyasaṅkhātā), dark (kaṇhā), reckoned as dark (kaṇhasaṅkhātā).
Who has completely abandoned these teachings (dhamme) and lives accordingly, the ascetic (samaṇo) Gotama, or those other venerable group-teachers (gaṇācariyā)?"
386.
“Kassapa, it is possible that the wise, cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might say this: ‘Those teachings (dhammā) of yours, revered ones (bhavataṃ), that are unskillful (akusala), reckoned as unskillful (akusalasaṅkhātā), blameworthy (sāvajja), reckoned as blameworthy (sāvajjasankhātā), not to be cultivated (asevitabbā), reckoned as not to be cultivated (asevitabbasaṅkhātā), not sufficient for the Noble Ones (alamariyā), reckoned as not sufficient for the Noble Ones (na alamariyasaṅkhātā), dark (kaṇhā), reckoned as dark (kaṇhasaṅkhātā).
The ascetic (samaṇo) Gotama has completely abandoned these teachings (dhamme) and lives accordingly, or those other venerable group-teachers (gaṇācariyā)."
Thus it is, Kassapa, The wise, when cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would mostly praise us.

387.
“Furthermore, Kassapa, the wise, when cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, might [praise] the Teacher with the Teacher or the Sangha with the Sangha, [saying]: ‘Those things of yours, venerable ones, that are skillful (kusala) and reckoned as such, blameless (anavajja) and reckoned as such, to be cultivated (sevitabba) and reckoned as such, fitting for a Noble One (ariya) and reckoned as such, bright (sukka) and reckoned as such.

The ascetic Gotama completely masters these things, but the other venerable teachers only in part.’

In this case, Kassapa, the wise, when cross-questioning, investigating, and discussing, would mostly praise us.

The Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo)

393.
“There is a path, Kassapa, there is a course of training, whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point—the Dhamma and the discipline.’

What is this path and this course of training? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo):

Right View (sammādiṭṭhi), Right Thought (sammāsaṅkappo), Right Speech (sammāvācā), Right Action (sammākammanto), Right Livelihood (sammāājīvo), Right Effort (sammāvāyāmo), Right Mindfulness (sammāsati), Right Concentration (sammāsamādhi).

This is the path, Kassapa, this is the course of training, whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself: ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point—the Dhamma and the discipline.’” Talks on Ascetic Practices
394.

When this was said, the naked ascetic Kāśyapa said this to the Blessed One: “Even these, friend Gotama, are considered ascetic practices, counted as asceticism and as Brahmanism by those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas*."

A naked ascetic lives, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal.

He does not accept food out of a pot or a pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.

He is a one-house man or a one-morsel man, a two-house man or a two-morsel man… he is a seven-house man or a seven-morsel man; he maintains himself with even one gift, he maintains himself with even two gifts… he maintains himself with even seven gifts; he takes food once a day, he takes food once every two days… he takes food once every seven days.

Thus, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals, even up to once every fortnight.
395.

“Even these, friend Gotama, are considered ascetic practices, counted as asceticism and as Brahmanism by those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas*."

Or he is an eater of greens or an eater of *sāmāka* millet, or an eater of wild rice, or an eater of *daddula* moss, or an eater of water plants, or an eater of rice bran, or an eater of rice scum, or an eater of oil-seed flour, or an eater of grass, or an eater of cow dung; he maintains himself on forest roots and fruits, he feeds on fallen fruits.
396.

“Even these, friend Gotama, are considered ascetic practices, counted as asceticism and as Brahmanism by those ascetics and *brāhmaṇas*."

He wears coarse hemp, or mixed hemp material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust heap, garments of bark fiber, antelope skins, antelope hide strips, *kusa*-grass fabric, bark fabric, wood-shaving fabric, blankets of human hair or horse hair, or the wings of owls. He is one who plucks out hair and beard, devoted to the practice of plucking out hair and beard.

He is one who stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is one who uses a mattress of spikes; he makes a mattress of spikes his bed. He sleeps on a wooden plank, or on bare ground. He is one who lies on one side, covered in dirt and grime. He is one who lives in the open air, accepting whatever seat is offered. He is one who avoids polite restraints, devoted to rejecting food. He is one who is devoted to the practice of rejecting water. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening.”

Talks on Pointless Asceticism
397.

"Kāśyapa, a practiser of self-mortification may do all these things, rejecting conventions, licking his hands…even up to once every fortnight, he dwells pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals.

But if his moral virtue (**śīlasampadā**), his mental perfection (**cittasampadā**), and his wisdom (**paññāsampadā**) are undeveloped and unrealized.

Then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) or a *brāhmaṇa*.

But when, Kāśyapa, a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will, and a heart full of loving-kindness, and, abandoning the corruptions, realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realized it in this very life by his own insight,

Then, Kāśyapa, that monk is termed an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) and a *brāhmaṇa*.’

Then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic. By means of asceticism.

But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness, and through the destruction of the defilements, realizes and dwells in the undefiled deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realized it in this very life by his own insight,

then, Kassapa, that monk is called an ascetic ( *śramaṇa*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).'

398.

When this had been said, Kassapa the Naked said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, it is hard to be an ascetic (*śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).'

‘So they say in the world, Kassapa: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).”

because even if he is naked, Kassapa, is of loose conduct, licks his hands…and lives devoted to the practice of taking food at stated intervals, even every half-month.

and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of being an ascetic (*śramaṇa*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*), it would not be right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*)”,

because any householder or householder’s son — even the slave-girl who draws water — could do this saying: “Well, I will go naked, be of loose conduct, lick my hands…and live devoted to the practice of taking food at stated intervals, even every half-month.”

But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic (*śramaṇa*), it is hard to be a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇa*).”

But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness, and through the destruction of the defilements, realizes and dwells in the undefiled deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realized it in this very life by his own insight,

because any householder or householder’s son — even the slave-girl who draws water — could do this saying: “Well, I will become an eater of greens or millet…and live on forest roots and fruits, I will feed on fallen fruits.” But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, a very different kind of striving in austerity, therefore it is right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.”

But, Kassapa, when a *bhikkhu* develops non-enmity (*averaṃ*), non-ill-will (*abyāpajjaṃ*) and a heart full of loving-kindness (*mettacittaṃ bhāveti*), and, abandoning the corruptions (*āsavānañca khayā*), realizes and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind (*anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ*), the deliverance through wisdom (*paññāvimuttiṃ*), having realized it in this very life (*diṭṭheva dhamme*) by his own insight (*sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati*).

Then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* is termed an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*).

"Even if, Kassapa, he wears hempen clothes (*sāṇāni cepi, kassapa, dhāreti*), wears hempen underclothes (*masāṇānipi dhāreti*) …pe… he dwells practicing the devotion of bathing every third evening (*sāyatatiyakampi udakorohanānuyogamanuyutto viharati*).

And if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of being an ascetic (*samaṇo*) or Brahmin (*brahmaññaṃ*), it would not be right to say: “It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.”

"And it would be possible for a householder (*gahapatinā*) or a householder's son (*gahapatiputtena*) or even a slave woman (*kumbhadāsiyāpi*) to do this: ‘Come now, I will wear hempen clothes (*sāṇāni dhāremi*), I will wear hempen underclothes (*masāṇānipi dhāremi*)…pe… I will dwell practicing the devotion of bathing every third evening (*sāyatatiyakampi udakorohanānuyogamanuyutto viharāmī*’ti).

Then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* is termed an ascetic (*samaṇo*) and a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*)."

399.

When this was said, the naked ascetic Kassapa said to the Blessed One: "Hard to understand, Venerable Gotama, is an ascetic (*samaṇo*), hard to understand is a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*)."

"So they say in the world, Kassapa: 'Hard to understand is an ascetic (*samaṇo*), hard to understand is a Brahmin (*brāhmaṇo*).'

Even if he is a naked ascetic (*acelako cepi, kassapa, hoti*), of loose conduct (*muttācāro*), a hand-licker (*hatthāpalekhano*)…pe… thus he dwells practicing the devotion of taking a meal on regular occasions every fortnight (*addhamāsikampi pariyāyabhattabhojanānuyogamanuyutto viharati*).

And if this were the measure and practice of asceticism (*samaṇo*) And even though, Kassapa, he wears hempen garments, or garments of hemp mixture… and he persists in the practice of going down into the water three times a day.

And if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of understanding an ascetic or Brahmin, it would not be right to say that, "It is hard to understand an ascetic or a Brahmin."

And it would be possible for a householder, or a householder's son, or even a female slave who uses a pot, to know: "This one wears hempen garments, or garments of hemp mixture… and he persists in the practice of going down into the water three times a day."

But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this, it is right to say: “It is hard to understand an ascetic or a Brahmin.”

But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness and, abandoning the corruptions, realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, having realised it in this very life by his own insight,

then, Kassapa, that monk is termed an ascetic and a Brahmin.’

The Perfection of Morality, Concentration, and Wisdom

400.

When this was said, the naked ascetic Kassapa said this to the Blessed One: “But what, venerable Gotama, is the perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*), what is the perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*), what is the perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)?” “Here, Kassapa, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one, a fully enlightened one… (as in sections 190-193, so it should be expanded) seeing fear in even the slightest faults, he trains himself, undertaking the rules of training. He is endowed with good bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, he is perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*), the doors of his senses are guarded, he is endowed with mindfulness and awareness, and he is content.

401.

“And how, Kassapa, is a *bhikkhu* perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*)? Here, Kassapa, a *bhikkhu*, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from taking life. He has laid aside the stick and the sword, he is scrupulous, kind, and dwells full of compassion for all living beings.

This also pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)… (as in sections 194 up to 210)

“Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, feeding on the food of the faithful, make their living by such base arts, such wrong means of livelihood

They make their living by: fortune-telling, interpreting omens… the prohibition of herbs and plants, and so on (as in section 211). He abstains from wrong livelihood, from such base arts.

This also pertains to his perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*).

"And then, Kassapa, that *bhikkhu* who is thus perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*) sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality.

Just as, Kassapa, a Khattiya king who has been anointed on the head, having defeated his enemies, sees no danger from any side, namely, from the enemy.

Just so, Kassapa, the *bhikkhu* who is thus perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*) sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality.

Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*śīlakkhandha*), he experiences within himself a blameless happiness (*anavajjasukha*).

Thus, Kassapa, a *bhikkhu* is perfected in morality (*śīlasampanna*).

That is the perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*)… he enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*.

This also pertains to his perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*)… he enters upon and abides in the second *jhāna*… the third *jhāna*… the fourth *jhāna*.

This also pertains to his perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*).

That is the perfection of mind (*cittasampadā*).

“So when his mind is thus concentrated… he directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*)… he understands: ‘There is nothing further here’… This also pertains to his perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

That, Kassapa, is the perfection of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

"And, Kassapa, there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality (*śīlasampadā*), of the heart (*cittasampadā*) and of wisdom (*prajñāsampadā*).

The Lion's Roar Discourse

402.

“Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach morality (*śīlavādā*).

They praise morality (*śīla*) in various ways.

But as regards the highest Ariyan morality (*śīla*), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this.

“Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach self-mortification and scrupulous austerity (*tapojigucchāvādā*).

They praise self-mortification and scrupulous austerity (*tapojigucchā*) in various ways.

But as regards the highest Ariyan Supreme is self-mortification and scrupulous austerity, Kassapa, I do not regard anyone as my equal in this respect, much less my superior! Indeed, I alone am superior in this, namely, extreme scrupulousness.
"There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdom (paññāvādā)."
They praise wisdom (paññā) in various ways.
But as regards the highest Ariyan wisdom (ariyā paramā paññā), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. Indeed, I alone am superior in this, namely, surpassing wisdom (adhipaññaṃ).
"There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberation (vimuttivādā)."
They praise liberation (vimutti) in various ways.
But as regards the highest Ariyan liberation (ariyā paramā vimutti), Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. Indeed, I alone am superior in this, namely, surpassing liberation (adhivimutti).

"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), but only in empty places, not in company (parisāsu).”
They should be told that this is not true:
“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), and he roars it in company (parisāsu).” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.
"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), and in company (parisāsu), but he does so without confidence (visārado).”
They should be told that this is not true:
“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), in company (parisāsu) and confidently (visārado).” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.
"Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar (sīhanādaṃ), in company (parisāsu) and confidently (visārado), but they do not question him…pe… they question him, but he does not answer them…pe… he answers them, but he does not win them over with his answers…pe… he wins them over with his answers, but they don’t find it pleasing…pe… they find it pleasing, but they are not satisfied with what they have heard…pe… they are satisfied with what they have They are satisfied, but they do not show an outward expression of satisfaction…and they show an outward expression of satisfaction, but they do not commit to the truth…and they commit to the truth, but those who have committed do not please [the teacher].’
They should be told, "This is not true."
“The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company he roars, and confidently he roars; and they question him, and when questioned by them, he explains, and with his explanation of the question, he pleases their minds; and they consider it worth listening to, and having heard it, they are satisfied, and they show an outward expression of satisfaction, and they commit to the truth, and those who have committed please [the teacher].” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.

Talk about the probation of those formerly of other sects.

404.
“Once, Kassapa, I was staying at Rājagaha, at Vulture’s Peak Mountain (Gijjhakūṭe pabbate)."
There, a certain ascetic and celibate named Nigrodha asked me a question at Adhijegucche.
When asked a question by him at Adhijegucche, I explained.
And he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure."
“Who, venerable sir (bhante), having heard the Dhamma of the Blessed One (bhagavato), would not be delighted beyond all measure? I, too, venerable sir (bhante), having heard the Dhamma of the Blessed One (bhagavato), am delighted beyond all measure."
Excellent, venerable sir (bhante), excellent, venerable sir (bhante).
Just as, venerable sir (bhante), one might set upright what has been overturned, or reveal what has been hidden, or point out the way to one who is lost, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes might see forms (rūpāṇi), even so has the Dhamma been made clear in many ways by the Blessed One (bhagavatā).
I go to the Blessed One (bhagavantaṃ) for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks (bhikkhusaṅghañca).
May I receive the going forth (pabbajjaṃ) in the Blessed One’s (bhagavato) presence, venerable sir (bhante)! May I receive the higher ordination (upasampadaṃ)!”
405.
"Kassapa, whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the going forth (pabbajjaṃ) or ordination (upasampadaṃ) in this Dhamma and discipline (dhammavinaye), he lives on probation for four months (cattāro māse parivasati), and at the end of four months (catunnaṃ māsānaṃ accayena), the monks (bhikkhū) who are established in mind (āraddhacittā) will give him the going forth (pabbājenti) and the monastic ordination (upasampādenti) into the state of a monk (bhikkhubhāvāya)."
But I recognize individual differences in this matter."
“If, venerable sir (bhante), those who formerly belonged to another sect (aññatitthiyapubbā) wish for the going forth (pabbajjaṃ), wish for the higher ordination (upasampadaṃ) in this Dhamma and discipline (dhammavinaye), they live on probation for four months (cattāro māse parivasanti), and at the end of four months (catunnaṃ māsānaṃ accayena), the monks (bhikkhū) who are established in mind (āraddhacittā) will give them the going forth (pabbājenti) and the monastic ordination (upasampādenti) into the state of a monk (bhikkhubhāvāya),
I will live on probation for four years (cattāri vassāni parivasissāmi), and at the end of four years (catunnaṃ vassānaṃ accayena), the monks (bhikkhū) who are established in mind (āraddhacittā) may give me the going forth (pabbājentu) and the monastic ordination (upasampādentu) into the state of a monk (bhikkhubhāvāya)." 9. The Poṭṭhapāda Sutta
The subject matter regarding the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda.

406. Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī (Śrāvastī), in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

Now at that time, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was living at the single-pavilion park of Mallikā (Queen Mallika) near the Tiṇḍuka tree, a place for philosophical debates, together with a large following of about three hundred wanderers.

Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms.

407. Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One: "It is still too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Suppose I were to visit Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer at Mallikā’s Park, the single-pavilion park near the Tiṇḍuka tree, a place for philosophical debates."

Then the Blessed One went to Mallikā’s Park, the single-pavilion park near the Tiṇḍuka tree, a place for philosophical debates.

408. At that time, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was sitting with a large assembly of wanderers, making a great noise and racket, engaged in many kinds of pointless conversation, such as:

Conversation about kings, robbers, ministers of state, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, street gossip, gossip by the well, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about the world and the sea, talk of being and non-being.

409. Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar. Seeing him, he hushed his following: “Be quiet, good sirs. Don’t make any noise.

Here comes the *śramaṇa* (ascetic) Gotama.

That venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet.

Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.”

When this was said, the wanderers fell silent.

410. Then the Blessed One went to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer.

Then Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Come, venerable sir, Blessed One!

Welcome, venerable sir, to the Blessed One!

It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here.

Be seated, venerable sir, Blessed One; this seat is ready.”

The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready.

Poṭṭhapāda, too, taking a lower seat, sat down at one side.

As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer: "What was the topic of conversation for which you are gathered together here now? What was the discussion that was interrupted?"

Discussion about the cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodhakathā*).

411. When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: “Let that conversation be, venerable sir, the one we were sitting here discussing.

It won’t be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later.

Some days ago, venerable sir, some time ago, when various *tīrthika* (sectarians), ascetics, and *brāhmaṇas* were sitting together gathered in the assembly hall, a discussion arose about the cessation of perception: ‘How, indeed, venerable sirs, does the cessation of perception come about?’ Thereupon some said: ‘Sensations arise and cease in a person without cause or condition.

When they arise, one is percipient.

When they cease, one is not percipient.’

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.

"Then another said: ‘No, that’spī.

'No, sir, that is how it will be.'

Perception (*saññā*) is a person’s self (*attā*).

which comes and goes.

When it comes, one is percipient.

When it goes, one is not percipient.'

That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (abhisaññānirodhaṃ).

"Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is, sir.

for there are contemplatives and Brahmins (*samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) of great power (mahiddhikā), great potency (mahānubhāvā).

They draw perception in and out of a person.

When they draw it in, one is percipient. “And, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment, having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, one’s abiding is stressful, you should not see it in that way.

When defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) are abandoned and bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now, there is joy (pāmujjaṃ), rapture (pīti), calm (passaddhi), mindfulness (sati), alertness (sampajañña), and a pleasant abiding (sukho vihāro).

“I also, Poṭṭhapāda, teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the mind-made appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

“And, Poṭṭhapāda, I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the formless appropriation of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (saṃkilesikā dhammā) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (vodāniyā dhammā) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now.

But, Poṭṭhapāda, it should not be regarded in that way. When defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) are abandoned and bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) have grown, and one enters & remains in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*prajñāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for oneself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissati*), there will be joy (*pāmujjaṃ*), rapture (*pīti*), calm (*passaddhi*), mindfulness (*sati*), alertness (*sampajaññaṃ*), and a pleasant abiding (*sukho vihāro*).

432.

"In the past, Poṭṭhapāda, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissatha*)?’ When asked this, I would answer, ‘This, friend, is that gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissatha*)’

433.

"In the past, Poṭṭhapāda, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissatha*)?’ When asked this, I would answer, ‘This, friend, is that mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissatha*)’

434.

"In the past, Poṭṭhapāda, I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*paññāpāripūriṃ vepullattaṃ*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissatha*)?’ Having been asked, we would answer thus: 'This, friend, is that formless appropriation of self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning we teach the *dharma*, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*prajñāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissathā’ti*.'

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t those words turn out to be convincing?” “Yes, lord. When this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing.”

435.

“Poṭṭhapāda, it’s as if a man were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace, right under that very palace.

and other people were to say to him, ‘Well, my good man, this palace for which you are building a staircase: Do you know whether it’s east, west, north, or south of here? Whether it’s high, low, or in between?’ He would say, ‘This, friends, is the palace to which I am building a staircase. The staircase is right under the palace.’

“So what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of that man turn out to be convincing?” “Yes, lord. When this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing.”

436.

“In the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, in the past I have been asked, ‘What, friend, is the gross appropriation of a self… the mind-made appropriation of a self… the formless appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the *Dhamma* such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow, and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*prajñāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissathā’ti*?’ When asked this, I would answer, ‘This, friend, is that formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) for whose abandoning I teach the *Dharma*, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities (*saṃkilesikā dhammā*) will be abandoned, bright mental qualities (*vodāniyā dhammā*) will grow,

and you will enter & remain in the culmination & abundance of discernment (*prajñāpāripūriṃ vepullattañca*), having known & realized it for yourself in the here & now (*diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharissathā’ti*).'

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t those words turn out to be convincing?” “Yes, lord. When this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing.”

437.

When this was said, Citta the elephant trainer’s son said to the Blessed One: “When there is a gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), is it the case then that one’s mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) and formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) are null & void, and only one’s gross appropriation of a self is true?

’And when there is a mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), is it the case then that one’s gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) and formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*) are null & void, and only one’s mind-made appropriation of a self is true?

And when there is a formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*), is it the case then that one’s gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) and mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) are null & void, and only one’s formless appropriation of a self is true?”

“Citta, when there is a gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), it’s not classified either as a mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*) or as a formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*). It’s classified just as a gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*).

When there is a mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), it’s not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) or as a formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*). It’s classified just as a mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*).

When there is a formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*), it’s not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) or as a mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*). It is classified just as a formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*).

438.

“Suppose they were to ask you: ‘Did you exist in the past (*atītamaddhānaṃ*)? Did you not not exist? Will you exist in the future (*anāgatamaddhānaṃ*)? Will you not not exist? Do you exist 439.
"In the same way, Citta, when there is a gross appropriation of a self ( *oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), at that time it’s not classified as a mind-made appropriation of a self ( *manomayo attapaṭilābho*), nor is it classified as a formless appropriation of a self ( *arūpo attapaṭilābho*).
It’s classified just as a gross appropriation of a self ( *oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) at that time.
When there is a mind-made appropriation of a self ( *manomayo attapaṭilābho*)… When there is a formless appropriation of a self ( *arūpo attapaṭilābho*), at that time it’s not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self ( *oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) or as a mind-made appropriation of a self ( *manomayo attapaṭilābho*). It’s classified just as a formless appropriation of a self ( *arūpo attapaṭilābho*) at that time.

“Just as, Citta, milk (*khīraṃ*) comes from a cow, curds (*dadhi*) from milk, butter (*navanītaṃ*) from curds, ghee (*sappi*) from butter, and the skimmings of ghee (*sappimaṇḍo*) from ghee.
When there is milk (*khīraṃ*), it’s not classified as curds (*dadhi*), butter (*navanītaṃ*), ghee (*sappi*), or skimmings of ghee (*sappimaṇḍo*). It’s classified just as milk (*khīraṃ*) at that time.
When there are curds (*dadhi*)… When there is butter (*navanītaṃ*)… When there is ghee (*sappi*)… When there are the skimmings of ghee (*sappimaṇḍo*), they’re not classified as milk (*khīraṃ*), curds (*dadhi*), butter (*navanītaṃ*), or ghee (*sappi*). They’re classified just as the skimmings of ghee (*sappimaṇḍo*) at that time.
In the same way, Citta, when there is a gross appropriation of a self ( *oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*)… When there is a mind-made appropriation of a self ( *manomayo attapaṭilābho*)… When there is a formless appropriation of a self ( *arūpo attapaṭilābho*), at that time it’s not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self ( *oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*) or as a mind-made appropriation of a self ( *manomayo attapaṭilābho*).

Citta, these are the world’s designations ( *lokasamaññā*), the world’s expressions ( *lokaniruttiyo*), the world’s ways of speaking ( *lokavohārā*), the world’s descriptions ( *lokapaññattiyo*), with which the Tathāgata expresses himself but without grasping to them."

441.
When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Buddha: “Excellent, venerable sir! Excellent, venerable sir! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms.
In the same way the Dhamma has been made clear by the Blessed One in many ways (*anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito*).
I go to the Blessed One for refuge (*bhagavantaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi*), and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks (*bhikkhusaṅghañca*).
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life. At that time, it is.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception ( *abhisaññānirodha*).
“Then someone else said, ‘No, that’s not how it is.
for there are gods (*devatā*) of great power (*mahiddhikā*), great potency (*mahānubhāvā*).
They draw perception in and out of a person.
When they draw it in, one is percipient.
When they draw it out, one is not percipient.’
That’s how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodha*).
“Then the memory of the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) arose within me: ‘Ah, the Blessed One (*bhagavā*)! Ah, the One Well-Gone (*sugato*)—who surely is well-skilled in these matters.’
The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodha*).
So what, lord (*bhante*), is the ultimate cessation of perception (*abhisaññānirodho*)?”
A talk on the arising and ceasing of perception with a cause.
412.
“In this regard, Poṭṭhapāda, those contemplatives & brahmans who say that a person’s perception (*saññā*) arises & ceases without cause, without reason, are wrong from the very start.
Why is that? Because a person’s perception (*saññā*) arises & ceases with a cause, with a reason, Poṭṭhapāda.
With training, one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases."
413.
"And what is training (*sikkhā*)?" The Blessed One (*bhagavā*) said, "Here, Poṭṭhapāda, the *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one (*arahaṃ*), a fully enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*)…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).
“This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.… “Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
“Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, the monk enters & remains in the first *jhāna*: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
His earlier perception of sensuality (*kāmasaññā*) ceases.
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture & pleasure born of seclusion.
And thus it is that with training one perception (*saññā*) arises and with training another perception (*saññā*) ceases.
This is training (*sikkhā*)" said the Blessed One (*bhagavā*). “And further, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of space (ākāsānañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), thinking, ‘Consciousness is infinite (anantaṃ viññāṇa).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.
And thus it is that with training one perception (saññā) arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.
“Again, Poṭṭhapāda, the monk, completely transcending the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness (viññāṇañcāyatana), enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatana), thinking, ‘There is nothing (natthi kiñcī).’
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases.
And on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness (ākiñcaññāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā). On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness.
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.
“This too is training,” the Blessed One said.

“Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception (saññaggaṃ).
As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ‘Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me.’
If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?’
So he neither thinks nor wills.
So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear.
He touches cessation (nirodhaṃ phusati).
This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception (anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti).
“Now what do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you ever before heard of such an alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception?” “No, venerable sir.”
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: ‘When the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, ”Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me. If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?”

So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear.

He touches cessation. (nirodhaṃ phusati)

This, Poṭṭhapāda, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception." (evaṃ kho, poṭṭhapāda, anupubbābhisaññānirodha-sampajāna-samāpatti hotī’'ti)

“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” (evaṃ, poṭṭhapādā)

415. “But, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception (saññaggaṃ) or many peaks of perception (saññagge)?” “Poṭṭhapāda, I describe one peak of perception (saññaggaṃ) and many peaks of perception (saññagge).”

“But how, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception (saññaggaṃ) and many peaks of perception (saññagge)?” “Poṭṭhapāda, in whatever way one touches cessation (nirodhaṃ phusati), in that way I describe the peak of perception (saññaggaṃ).

That’s how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.”

416. “Now, lord, does perception (saññā) arise first, and knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) after; or does knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) arise first, and perception (saññā) after; or do perception (saññā) & knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) arise simultaneously?” “Poṭṭhapāda, perception (saññā) arises first, and knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) after. And the arising of knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) comes from the arising of perception (saññā).

One discerns, ‘It’s in dependence on this that my knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) has arisen.’

Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception (saññā) arises first, and knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) after, and how the arising of knowledge (ñāṇaṃ) comes from the arising of perception (saññā).”

A talk on self and perception (saññāattakathā).

417. “Now, lord, is perception (saññā) a person’s self (attā), or is perception (saññā) one thing and self (attā) another?” “What kind of self (attā) do you posit, Poṭṭhapāda?” “Lord, I posit a gross self (attānaṃ), possessed of form (rūpiṃ), made up of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtikaṃ), feeding on physical food (kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkhaṃ).”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self (attā) would be gross (oḷāriko), possessed of form (rūpī), made up of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtiko), feeding on physical food (kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho).

That being the case, then for you perception (saññā) would be one thing and self (attā) another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.

even as there remains this gross self (attā)—possessed of form (rūpī), made up of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtiko), and feeding on food—one perception (saññā) arises for that person as another perception (saññā) passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.”

418. “Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self (attānaṃ) complete in all its parts (sabbaṅgapaccaṅgiṃ), not inferior in its faculties (ahīnindriyaṃ).”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self (attā) would be mind-made (manomayo), complete in all its parts (sabbaṅgapaccaṅgī), not inferior in its faculties (ahīnindriyo). That being the case, then for you perception (saññā) would be one thing and self (attā) another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.

even as there remains this mind-made self (attā)—complete in all its parts (sabbaṅgapaccaṅgī), not inferior in its faculties (ahīnindriyo)—one perception (saññā) arises for that person as another perception (saññā) passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.”

419. “Then, lord, I posit a formless self (attānaṃ) made of perception (saññāmaya).”

“Then, Poṭṭhapāda, your self (attā) would be formless (arūpī) and made of perception (saññāmayo). That being the case, then for you perception (saññā) would be one thing and self (attā) another.

And it’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.

”even as there remains this formless self (attā) made of perception (saññāmayo), one perception (saññā) arises for that person as another perception (saññā) passes away.

It’s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception (saññā) will be one thing and self (attā) another.”

420. “Is it possible for me to know, lord, whether perception (saññā) is a person’s self (attā) or if perception (saññā) is one thing and self (attā) another?”
"Poṭṭhapāda, since you have other views (*aññadiṭṭhi*), other practices (*aññakhanti*), other preferences (*aññaruci*), other aims (*aññatrayoga*), and other teachers (*aññatrācariyaka*), it is difficult for you to know whether perception (*saññā*) is a person's self (*attā*), or whether perception is one thing and the self is another." 421. Then, the wanderers, not long after the Blessed One had departed, taunted Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer from all sides with words like stinging darts, saying, "Indeed, whatever the *śramaṇa* Gotama says, this venerable Poṭṭhapāda approves, saying, 'So it is, Blessed One; so it is, O Well-Gone One!'".

"But we do not understand the *śramaṇa* Gotama to have taught any definitive doctrine, whether the world is eternal (*śassato loko’ti vā*), or the world is not eternal (*asassato loko’ti vā*), or the world is finite (*antavā loko’ti vā*), or the world is infinite (*anantavā loko’ti vā*), or the life-principle (*jīva*) is the same as the body (*taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīra’nti vā*), or the life-principle is one thing and the body another (*aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīra’nti vā*), or the *Tathāgata* exists after death (*hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā’ti vā*), or the *Tathāgata* does not exist after death (*na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā’ti  vā*), or the *Tathāgata* both exists and does not exist after death (*hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā’ti vā*), or the *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā’ti vā*)."

When this was said, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to those wanderers, "I, too, friends, do not understand the *śramaṇa* Gotama to have taught any definitive doctrine, whether the world is eternal (*śassato loko’ti vā*), or the world is not eternal (*asassato loko’ti vā*)… or the *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist after death (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā’ti vā*). But the *śramaṇa* Gotama teaches a practice that is genuine, real, and in accordance with reality, a principle of the *Dhamma* and consistent with the nature of the *Dhamma*.

"When a practice is genuine, real, and in accordance with reality, a principle of the *Dhamma* and consistent with the nature of the *Dhamma*, how could a discerning person like myself not approve of the well-spoken words of the *śramaṇa* Gotama?"

The Story of Citta, Hatthiśāriputta, and Poṭṭhapāda.

422. Then, two or three days later, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One. Having arrived, Citta the son of Hatthiśāriputta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.

But Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having exchanged courteous and agreeable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One, "Just now, *bhante*, those wanderers taunted me on all sides with words like stinging darts, saying, 'Indeed, whatever the venerable Poṭṭhapāda The contemplative Gotama speaks, and Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word: "So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-Gone."
But we don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or whether the cosmos is finite ( *antavā loko* ) or the cosmos is infinite ( *anantavā loko* ) or whether the soul and the body are the same ( *taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīraṃ*) or the soul is one thing and the body another ( *aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīraṃ*) or whether after death a Tathāgata exists ( *hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata does not exist ( *na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ) or after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist ( *hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) or after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*) .’

When this was said, I replied to the wanderers, ‘I, too, don’t understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal ( *sassato loko* ) or the cosmos is not eternal ( *asassato loko* ) or… whether after death a *Tathāgata* neither exists nor does not exist ( *neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā* ). But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma.

And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained, why shouldn’t a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well-spokenness of the contemplative Gotama’s well-spoken words?”

423. "Poṭṭhapāda, all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes. You alone among them have eyes.

I have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical ( *ekaṃsikāpi* ), and some teachings to be not categorical ( *anekaṃsikāpi* ).

"And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be not categorical ( *anekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* )? ‘The cosmos is eternal’ (*sassato loko*)… ‘The cosmos is not eternal’ (*asassato loko*)… ‘The cosmos is finite’ (*antavā loko*)…‘The cosmos is infinite’ (*anantavā loko*)… ‘The soul & the body are the same’ (*taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīraṃ*)… ‘The soul is one thing and the body another’ (*aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīraṃ*)… ‘After death a Tathāgata exists’ (*hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*)… ‘After death a Tathāgata does not exist’ (*na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*)… ‘After death a Tathāgata both exists & does not exist’ (*hoti ca na ca hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*)…

‘After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist’ (*neva hoti na na hoti tathāgato paraṃ maraṇā*), Poṭṭhapāda, I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching ( *anekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto* ).

"And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be not categorical ( *anekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* )? Because they are not conducive to the goal, are not conducive to the Dhamma, are not basic to the holy life. They don’t lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.

That’s why I have taught and declared them to be not categorical ( *anekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* )".

Categorical Teaching ( *ekaṃsikadhammo* )

424. "And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be categorical ( *ekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* )? ‘This is stress’ (*idaṃ dukkhaṃ*) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching ( *ekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto* ).

‘This is the origination of stress’ (*ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo*) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching ( *ekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto* ).

‘This is the cessation of stress’ (*ayaṃ dukkhanirodho*) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching ( *ekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto* ).

‘This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress’ (*ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*) I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching ( *ekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto* ).

"And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical ( *ekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* )? Because they are conducive to the goal, are conducive to the Dhamma, are basic to the holy life. They lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.

That’s why I have taught and declared them to be categorical ( *ekaṃsikā dhammā desitā paññattā* ).

425. “There are some contemplatives & brahmans with a doctrine & view like this: ‘After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease’ ( *ekantasukhī attā hoti arogo paraṃ maraṇā* ).

I approached them and asked them, ‘Is it true that you have a doctrine & view like this: “After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease” ( *ekantasukhī attā hoti arogo paraṃ maraṇā*)?’ If, when asked this, they acknowledge, ‘Yes.’

So I asked them, ‘But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world ( *ekantasukhaṃ lokaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ viharatha* )?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

So I asked them, ‘But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy (*ekantasukhiṃ attānaṃ*) for a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ ‘Are you aware?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

Then I say this: ‘But venerable sirs, do you know that “This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world”?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

"Then I say this: ‘But venerable sirs, have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, “Practice well, dear sirs. Practice straightforwardly, dear sirs, for the realization of an exclusively happy world, because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world”?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

"What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing?" "Surely, venerable sir, that being so, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be unconvincing."

426. "Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to say, ‘I’m in love with the most beautiful woman in this country.’

Then they might say to him, ‘Good man, this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love: do you know if she’s of the warrior caste, the *brāhmaṇa* caste, the merchant caste, or the worker caste?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘No.’

Then they might say to him, ‘Good man, this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love: do you know her name or clan name? Whether she’s tall, short, or of medium height? Whether she’s dark, fair, or ruddy-skinned? Do you know what village or town or city she’s from?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘No.’

Then they might say to him, ‘Good man, do you then love a girl you have never known or seen?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘Yes.’

"What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing?" "Surely, venerable sir, that being so, that man’s talk would amount to nonsense."

"In the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* with a doctrine and view like this: ‘After death, the self (*ātmā*) is exclusively happy and free from disease.’

I approached them and said, ‘Is it true that you venerable sirs have such a doctrine?" Of such views, (they say): “The self is exclusively happy, free from disease after death.” And when they are asked this, they acknowledge ‘Yes.’

Then I say to them, ‘But do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world (ekantasukhaṃ lokaṃ)?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

Then I say to them, ‘But have you ever been aware of a self (attānam) exclusively happy for a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

Then I say to them, ‘But do you know that “This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world (ekantasukhassa lokassa sacchikiriyāya)?”’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

Then I say to them, ‘But have you heard the voices of devas (devatā) reborn in an exclusively happy world (ekantasukhaṃ lokaṃ), saying, “Practice well, dear sirs (mārisā). Practice straightforwardly, dear sirs (mārisā), for the realization of an exclusively happy world (ekantasukhassa lokassa sacchikiriyāya), because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world (ekantasukhaṃ lokaṃ)?”’ When asked this, they say, ‘No.’

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of those contemplatives & brahmans (samaṇabrāhmaṇānaṃ) turn out to be unconvincing?” "Yes, venerable sir (bhante). When this is the case, the words of those contemplatives & brahmans (samaṇabrāhmaṇānaṃ) turn out to be unconvincing."

427.

“Poṭṭhapāda, it’s as if a man at a crossroads (cātumahāpathe) were to build a staircase (nisseṇiṃ kareyya) for ascending to a palace (pāsādassa ārohaṇāya).

Then they would say to him: ‘Good man (ambho purisa), this staircase (nisseṇiṃ karosi) you are building for ascending to a palace (pāsādassa ārohaṇāya): Do you know whether that palace (pāsādaṃ) is east, south, west, or north of here? Whether it’s high, low, or in between?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘No.’

Then they would say to him: ‘Good man (ambho purisa), you don’t know or see what kind of a palace (pāsādassa) you are building the staircase (nisseṇiṃ karosi) for?’ When asked this, he would say, ‘Yes.’

“What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? When this is the case, don’t the words of that man (purisassa) turn out to be unconvincing?” "Surely, venerable sir (bhante), that being so, that man’s (purisassa) talk would amount to nonsense.” Just so, Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who maintain this view and doctrine: ‘The self after death is exclusively happy and free from disease.’

I approached them and asked: ‘Is it true that you, venerable sirs, hold such a view and doctrine: "The self after death is exclusively happy and free from disease"?’ If, when questioned thus, they acknowledge it as so,

I then say to them: ‘Do you, venerable sirs, dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Have you ever been aware of a self that is exclusively happy for even a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Do you know that "This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

I then say to them: ‘Have you heard the voices of the gods who have been reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, "We are practicing well, dear ones; we are practicing uprightly, dear ones, for the realization of an exclusively happy world. It was through such practice that we were reborn in an exclusively happy world?"’ When asked this, they reply, ‘No.’

What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? In that case, doesn’t it follow that the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing?" "Indeed, lord, in that case, the words of those ascetics and Brahmins are unconvincing."

Three appropriations of self

"Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three appropriations of self (*attapaṭilābhā*): the gross appropriation of a self (*oḷāriko attapaṭilābho*), the mind-made appropriation of a self (*manomayo attapaṭilābho*), and the formless appropriation of a self (*arūpo attapaṭilābho*).

And what, Poṭṭhapāda, is the gross appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), composed of the four great elements (*cātumahābhūtiko*), and feeds on solid food (*kabaḷīkārāhārabhakkho*). This is the gross appropriation of a self.

And what is the mind-made appropriation of a self? It is one that is possessed of form (*rūpī*), mind-made (*manomayo*), complete in all its parts (*sabbaṅgapaccaṅgī*), not deficient in its faculties (*ahīnindriyo*). This is the mind-made appropriation of a self.

And what is the formless appropriation of a self? It is formless (*arūpī*) and made of perception (*saññāmayo*). This is the formless appropriation of a self. 4. The Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta
The Brahmins and Householders of Campā

300. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was travelling among the Aṅgas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at Campā.

At Campā he stayed by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

At that time the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living at Campā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers, a gift according to Brahmanical rights ( *brahmadeyyaṃ*).

301. And the Brahmins and householders of Campā heard say: “The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyans, who has gone forth from the Śākya clan is travelling among the Aṅgas… and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pool.

concerning whom a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), perfected in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a Well-Farer (*sugato*), Knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), Teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha, a Bless­ed Lord.”

He declares this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses (*sassamaṇa*) and brahmins (*brāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and its people, which he has himself realised by direct knowledge (*abhiññā*).

He teaches the Dhamma that is good at the beginning, good in the middle and good at the end, with the right meaning and expression, and reveals the spiritual life (*brahmacariyaṃ*) that is utterly perfect and pure.

…Now it is good see such *arahants*.”

Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campā, leaving Campā in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.

302. Just then, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest.

Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggara’s lotus-pond,

he asked his steward the reason. "Having departed from Campā, they are approaching the Gaggarā pond as an assembly, a crowd?" "Indeed, sir, the *śramaṇa* Gotama, a son of the Śākya clan, having gone forth from the Śākya family, wandering in the Aṅga country, has arrived at Campā together with a great community of *bhikkhus*, with approximately five hundred *bhikkhus*, and dwells in Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā pond.
And concerning that venerable Gotama such a fine reputation has arisen: 'Indeed, that Blessed One is an *arhat*, a fully enlightened Buddha, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, knower of the worlds, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'
They are approaching that venerable Gotama for a sight of him."
"Then, steward, go to the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka and say to them: 'The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: "Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him."'"
"Yes, sir," the steward replied to the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, and he approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, and having approached the *brāhmaṇa* householders of Campeyyaka, he said this: "The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa says thus: 'Please wait, gentlemen, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.'"
The Story of Soṇadaṇḍa's Virtues

303.
Now at that time, five hundred *brāhmaṇas*, from various foreign lands, were residing in Campā on some business or other.
The *brāhmaṇas* heard: "The *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, it is said, will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him."
Then the *brāhmaṇas* approached the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, and having approached the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa, they said this: "Is it true, sir, that the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him?" "Yes, sir, it occurs to me: 'I too will approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.'"
"Sir, do not approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.
The *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is not worthy to approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him.
If the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa approaches the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him,
those desiring the meaning of the *mantras*, desiring to study the *mantras*, will come to the presence of the *bhoto* Soṇadaṇḍa …pe…
"For the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is old, aged, venerable, advanced in years, having reached old age, the *śramaṇa* Gotama is young, both youthful and recently gone forth…pe…
"For the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is esteemed, respected, honored, revered, venerated by King Bimbisāra, of the Magadha, Seniya…pe…
"For the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is esteemed, respected, honored, revered, venerated by the *brāhmaṇa* Pokkharasāti…pe…
"For the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa dwells in Campā, populous, with grass, timber, and water, with grain, a royal possession, given by King Bimbisāra, of Magadha, Seniya, a royal gift, a *brahmadeyya*.
And since the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa dwells in Campā, populous, with grass, timber, and water, with grain, a royal possession, given by King Bimbisāra, of Magadha, Seniya, a royal gift, a *brahmadeyya*,
by this reason the *bhava* Soṇadaṇḍa is not worthy to approach the *śramaṇa* Gotama for a sight of him, but rather the *śramaṇa* Gotama is worthy to approach the *bhavantaṃ* Soṇadaṇḍa for a sight of him."
The Story of the Buddha's Virtues

304.
When this was said, the *brāhmaṇa* Soṇadaṇḍa said this to those *brāhmaṇas*:
"Then, sirs, listen to me also, as to how we ourselves are worthy to approach that venerable Gotama for a sight of him, but that *bhava* Gotama is not at all worthy to approach us for a sight of him.
The *śramaṇa* Gotama, sirs, is well-born on both sides, from mother and father, of pure descent as far back as the seventh generation of ancestors, unassailed, unimpeached in regard to birth.
And since, sir, the *śramaṇa* Gotama is well-born on both sides, from mother and father, of pure descent as far back as the seventh generation of ancestors, unassailed, unimpeached in regard to birth, by this reason that *bhava* Gotama is not worthy to approach us for a sight of him. Indeed, King Pasenadi of Kosala has gone for refuge to the ascetic Gotama (Gotama), together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers.
Indeed, the Brahmin Pokkharasati has gone for refuge to the ascetic Gotama (Gotama), together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers.
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha…
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Pasenadi of Kosala…
Indeed, the ascetic Gotama is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by the Brahmin Pokkharasati…
The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond.
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests.
And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship guests.
Having come to Gaggara’s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such.
Therefore it is not proper that the revered Gotama should come to us to visit.
But rather we should go to the revered Gotama to visit.
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is insufficient, for the revered Gotama is beyond all praise.
305.
When this was said, the Brahmins said to the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa: ‘Sir, since the revered Soṇadaṇḍa speaks so highly of the ascetic Gotama, then even if the revered Gotama were to live a hundred *yojanas* from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him.
‘Therefore, sir, we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.’
Soṇadaṇḍa's thought

306.
Then the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa went with a large company of Brahmins to the lotus-pond of Gaggara.
But when Soṇadaṇḍa had traversed the jungle-thickets, he thought: ‘If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: “That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question, it is not at all a fitting question”, and then the company might despise me, saying: “Soṇadaṇḍa is a fool, he has no sense, he can’t put a proper question to the ascetic Gotama.”
And if anyone were despised by this company, his reputation would suffer.
and if a man’s reputation suffers, his income suffers…
for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation.
Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question, my answer might not satisfy him, and he might say: “That is not the right way to answer this ques­tion.” And then the company-might despise me…
And if anyone were despised by this company, his reputation would suffer.
and if a man’s reputation suffers, his income suffers…
for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation.
And if, having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama, I were to turn away without showing myself, this company might des­pise me…’
And if anyone were despised by this company, his reputation would suffer.
and if a man’s reputation suffers, his income suffers… for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation.

307.
Then the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa approached the Blessed One, exchanged cour­tesies with him,
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side.
The Campa people Some of the Brahmins and householders, having paid homage to the Blessed One (bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā), sat down to one side. Some exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One (bhagavatā saddhiṃ sammodiṃsu), and after an exchange of friendly and courteous greetings, sat to one side. Some, having raised their hands palm-to-palm in front of the heart to the Blessed One (añjaliṃ paṇāmetvā), sat to one side. Some, after announcing their name and clan (nāmagottaṃ sāvetvā), sat to one side. Some, remaining silent (tuṇhībhūtā), sat to one side.

308.
There, also, Sona-danda the Brahmin was sitting, reflecting deeply on this very matter: "If I were to ask the ascetic Gotama a question (pañhaṃ puccheyyaṃ), and Gotama were to say to me, 'This is not the way to ask this question, Brahmin (brāhmaṇa), this is how the question should be asked,' then this assembly would despise me, saying, 'Sona-danda the Brahmin is foolish and inept; he could not ask the ascetic Gotama a question properly (yoniso pañhaṃ pucchitu)'."

And if anyone were despised by this assembly (parisā paribhaveyya), his reputation (yaso) would suffer.

And if his reputation (yaso) were to suffer, his income (bhogāpi) would suffer.

For our income (bhogā) depends on the gaining of a reputation (yasoladdhā).

And if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question (pañhaṃ puccheyya), and I could not satisfy his mind (cittaṃ na ārādheyyaṃ) with an explanation (veyyākaraṇena), and Gotama were to say to me, 'This is not the way to explain this question, Brahmin (brāhmaṇa), this is how the question should be explained,' then this assembly would despise me, saying, 'Sona-danda the Brahmin is foolish and inept; he could not satisfy the mind (cittaṃ ārādhetu) of the ascetic Gotama with an explanation (veyyākaraṇena) of the question.'

And if anyone were despised by this assembly (parisā paribhaveyya), his reputation (yaso) would suffer.

And if his reputation (yaso) were to suffer, his income (bhogāpi) would suffer.

For our income (bhogā) depends on the gaining of a reputation (yasoladdhā).

Oh, if only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question (pañhaṃ puccheyya) about my own field of the three Vedas (tevijjake)! Surely, I could satisfy his mind (cittaṃ ārādheyyaṃ) with an explanation (veyyākaraṇena) of the question!"

Brahminical tenets (brāhmaṇapaññatti)

309.
Then, the Blessed One (bhagavato), knowing with his mind the thoughts in the mind of Sona-danda the Brahmin (soṇadaṇḍassa brāhmaṇassa cetasā cetoparivitakkamaññāya), thought: "This Sona-danda the Brahmin (soṇadaṇḍo brāhmaṇo) is troubled in his own mind (sakena cittena).

Suppose I were to ask Sona-danda the Brahmin (soṇadaṇḍaṃ brāhmaṇaṃ) a question (pañhaṃ puccheyya) about his own field of the three Vedas (tevijjake)!"

Then, the Blessed One (bhagavā)... Then he said to Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin: “By how many qualities, O Brahmin, do Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?”

310. Then it occurred to Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin: “That which I wanted, that which I longed for, that which I desired, that which I yearned for—‘Oh, that the ascetic Gotama might ask me a question about my own teachers, the three-Veda experts! Surely, I would satisfy his mind with an explanation of the question’—now the ascetic Gotama asks me a question about my own teachers, the three-Veda experts.
Assuredly, I shall satisfy his mind with an explanation of the question!"

311. Then Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin, straightening up, looking around the assembly, said to the Blessed One: “With five qualities, revered Gotama, Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood.

Which are the five? Here, revered Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both sides, from the mother's side and from the father's side, of pure descent back to the seventh generation of ancestors, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to birth; he is a reciter, a holder of the *mantras* (mantradharo), one who has reached the further shore of the three *vedas* (vedānaṃ pāragū) with their vocabularies (*nighaṇḍu*) and supplementary texts (*keṭubha*), skilled in phonology (*sākkharappabheda*), and the lore of legends as a fifth, versed in the etymology (*padako*) and grammar (*veyyākaraṇo*), and experienced in the *lokāyata* (lokāyata) and the characteristics of a great man (*mahāpurisalakkhaṇa*); he is handsome, pleasant to look at, inspiring confidence, possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion, with a brahmin-like appearance and a brahmin-like glow, not dwarfish, and delightful to behold; he is virtuous, with developed virtue, possessed of developed virtue; and he is learned and wise, whether he be the first or the second to accept the sacrificial ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these five qualities, revered Gotama, that Brahmins designate a Brahmin, so that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood.”

“But, Brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five qualities, so that with four qualities, Brahmins might designate a Brahmin, and that one declaring ‘I am a Brahmin’ would speak truthfully and not incur falsehood?” ‘It is possible, Gotama.’
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out appearance of these five qualities.
What can appearance do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unimpeached, irreproachable in matters of caste; he is a reciter and upholder of the mantras, one who has gone to the further shore of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, etymologies and phonology, and with the lore of legends as a fifth, skilled in word and sentence, and a master of Lokāyata and the characteristics of a great man; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
If a Brahmin is endowed with these four qualities, Brahmins recognize him as a Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood.’
312.
‘But, Brahmin, if one of these four qualities could be omitted, leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood?’ ‘It is possible, Master Gotama.’
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out the mantras, of these four qualities.
What can mantras do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unimpeached, irreproachable in matters of caste; he is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
If a Brahmin is endowed with these three qualities, Brahmins recognize him as a Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood.’
‘But, Brahmin, if one of these three qualities could be omitted, leaving two whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood?’ ‘It is possible, Master Gotama.’
Indeed, Master Gotama, we could leave out birth of these three qualities.
What can birth do? For, Master Gotama, a Brahmin is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue; he is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.
If a Brahmin is endowed with these two qualities, Brahmins recognize him as a Brahmin, and declaring ‘I am a Brahmin,’ he might speak truly, and would not incur falsehood.’
313.
When this was said, those Brahmins said to the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa: ‘Do not say that, Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa, do not say that!
The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is decrying appearance, the mantras and birth, entirely.
The Reverend Soṇadaṇḍa is actually adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words!’
314.
Then the Lord said to the Brahmins: ‘If you think the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is not concentrating on his task, is using wrong words, is lacking in wisdom, and is not fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then let him cease, and you talk to me.
But if you think he is learned, speaks properly, is wise and fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then you cease and let him speak.’
315.
Then Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin said this to the Blessed One: "Let Reverend Gotama stay, let Reverend Gotama be silent, I myself will give an answer in accordance with the Dhamma."
Then Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahmin said this to those Brahmins: “Do not say that, venerable sirs, do not say that: ‘Venerable Soṇadaṇḍa disparages appearance, he disparages the sacred verses, he disparages birth entirely.
Venerable Soṇadaṇḍa is siding with the doctrine of Gotama the ascetic.’
I do not disparage appearance, sacred verses, or birth." 316. Now at that time, Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin's* nephew, a young man named Aṅgaka, was sitting in that assembly.

Then Soṇadaṇḍa the *brāhmin* said to those *brāhmins*: “Do you see this young man Aṅgaka, my nephew?” “Yes, sir.”

“Aṅgaka, is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, endowed with the highest beauty, with the hue of Brahmā, the splendor of Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama.

Aṅgaka, is a student, a *mantra*-reciter, a master of the three *vedas*, along with their vocabularies (nighaṇḍu), etymology (keṭubha), phonology (sākkharappabheda), and histories as the fifth (itihāsapañcama); he is skilled in philology (padaka) and grammar (veyyākaraṇa), and is fully versed in natural philosophy (lokāyata) and the marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisalakkhaṇa).

I am his teacher of *mantras*.

Aṅgaka, is well-born on both sides, from the mother and from the father, of pure descent for seven generations, unblemished and irreproachable in regard to his birth.

I know his parents.

Aṅgaka, could even kill a living being, take what is not given, go to another’s wife, speak falsely, and drink intoxicants. What good then, sir, would appearance do, what good would *mantras* do, what good would birth do? But when, sir, a *brāhmin* is virtuous, of advanced virtue, endowed with advanced virtue, and wise, intelligent, whether he is first or second in seizing the ladle (sujaṃ paggaṇhantānaṃ).

It is with these two qualities that *brāhmins* recognize a *brāhmin*, and one who declares, ‘I am a *brāhmin*’ would speak truthfully, and would not incur falsehood.”

The Discourse on Morality and Wisdom (sīlapaññākathā).

317. “But, *brāhmin*, is it possible that one of these two qualities could be set aside, and with one quality, *brāhmins* could recognize a *brāhmin*, and one who declares, ‘I am a *brāhmin*’ would speak truthfully, and would not incur falsehood?” “No, Gotama.”

Morality purifies wisdom, and wisdom purifies morality (sīlaparidhotā hi paññā, paññāparidhotaṃ sīlaṃ).

Where there is morality, there is wisdom; where there is wisdom, there is morality (yattha sīlaṃ tattha paññā, yattha paññā tattha sīlaṃ).

The moral man has wisdom, and the wise man has morality (sīlavato paññā, paññavato sīlaṃ).

And the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world (sīlapaññāṇañca pana lokasmiṃ aggamakkhāyati).

Just as, sir, one might wash a hand with a hand, or a foot with a foot, even so, sir, morality purifies wisdom, Wisdom is purified by morality ( *śīla*).
Where there is morality (*śīla*), there is wisdom (*prajñā*); where there is wisdom (*prajñā*), there is morality (*śīla*).
The moral one has wisdom (*prajñā*), and the wise one has morality (*śīla*).
And the combination of morality (*śīla*) and wisdom (*prajñā*) is called the highest thing in the world.
‘So it is, Brahmin. So it is, Brahmin. Morality (*śīla*) purifies wisdom (*prajñā*), and wisdom (*prajñā*) purifies morality (*śīla*).
Where there is morality (*śīla*), there is wisdom (*prajñā*); where there is wisdom (*prajñā*), there is morality (*śīla*).
The moral one has wisdom (*prajñā*), and the wise one has morality (*śīla*).
And the combination of morality (*śīla*) and wisdom (*prajñā*) is called the highest thing in the world.
Just as, Brahmin, one hand might wash the other, or one foot the other, so too, Brahmin, morality (*śīla*) is purified by wisdom (*prajñā*), and wisdom (*prajñā*) is purified by morality (*śīla*).
Where there is morality (*śīla*), there is wisdom (*prajñā*); where there is wisdom (*prajñā*), there is morality (*śīla*).
The moral one has wisdom (*prajñā*), and the wise one has morality (*śīla*).
And the combination of morality (*śīla*) and wisdom (*prajñā*) is called the highest thing in the world.
318.
“But what is that morality (*śīla*), Brahmin? What is that wisdom (*prajñā*)?” “We have reached just this limit in this matter, venerable Gotama.
It would be well if the venerable Gotama himself would clarify the meaning of this statement."
“Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa to the Blessed One.
The Blessed One said this: "Here, Brahmin, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one, a fully enlightened one…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be explained in detail).
Thus, Brahmin, a monk is perfected in morality (*śīla*).
This, Brahmin, is morality (*śīla*)…pe… He attains the first *jhāna* and abides in it…pe… the second *jhāna*…pe… the third *jhāna*…pe… He attains the fourth *jhāna* and abides in it…pe… He directs and inclines his mind to knowledge and vision.
This too he has by wisdom (*prajñā*)…pe… He understands, ‘There is nothing further here.’ This too he has by wisdom (*prajñā*). This, Brahmin, is wisdom (*prajñā*)."
Soṇadaṇḍa's avowal as a lay follower.
319.
When this was said, the Brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, venerable Gotama, excellent, venerable Gotama.
Just as, venerable Gotama, one might set upright what was overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or hold up an oil lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes might see forms, in the same way the Dharma has been made clear in many ways by venerable Gotama.
I go to the venerable Gotama for refuge, and to the Dharma, and to the *Bhikkhu-saṃgha*.
May the esteemed Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forth, as long as life shall last. Morality is [now] covered.
And may the Reverend Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Community of monks.
The Lord signified his acceptance by silence.
Then Sonadanda, the Brahmin, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Lord, and circumambulating him, departed.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, as the night was ending, had exquisite staple and non-staple food prepared in his own home, and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It’s time, good Gotama. The meal is ready.”
Then the Blessed One, having dressed in the early morning and taking his bowl and robes, went with the Community of *bhikkhus* to Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*'s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* personally served the Community of *bhikkhus*, with the Buddha at their head, with choice staple and non-staple food until they were satisfied.
Then Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa*, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had removed his hand from the bowl, took a low seat and sat down to one side.
Sitting to one side, Sonadanda the *brāhmaṇa* said this to the Blessed One: "If, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to rise from my seat and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer.
And if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to raise my joined palms [in greeting], may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat.
And if, good Gotama, being present in an assembly, I were to take off my turban, may the Reverend Gotama take it as a bow of my head.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to alight from the carriage and salute the Reverend Gotama, that assembly would despise me.
And if that assembly were to despise me, my reputation would suffer, and if my reputation were to suffer, my income would also suffer.
For our income depends on gaining a reputation.
And if, good Gotama, being in a carriage, I were to raise my goad, may the Reverend Gotama consider that as my alighting from the carriage.” 10. The Subha Sutta
The topic of Subha, the student.

444. Thus have I heard: At one time the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling near Sāavatthī, in Jeta's Grove at Anāthapindika's Park, not long after the Blessed One's complete passing away.

At that time, Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, was staying in Sāavatthī for some particular reason.

445. Then Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, addressed a certain young man: "Come, young man, go to where the ascetic Ānanda is, and upon arriving, ask the ascetic Ānanda in my words whether he is free from illness, free from disease, of light frame, strong, and living in comfort, saying: 'Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks the Venerable Ānanda whether he is free from illness, free from disease, of light frame, strong, and living in comfort.'

And speak thus: 'It would be good if the Venerable Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.'"

446. "Yes, sir," the young man replied to Subha, the student, son of Todeyya. He then went to where the Venerable Ānanda was, and upon arriving, exchanged friendly greetings with the Venerable Ānanda.

Having concluded the courteous and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, the young man said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks the Venerable Ānanda whether he is free from illness, free from disease, of light frame, strong, and living in comfort, and he further says: 'It would be good if the Venerable Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.'"

447. When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda told that young man, "It is an unsuitable time, young man.

Today I have taken some medicine.

Perhaps tomorrow we might come, depending on the right time and occasion."

"Yes, sir," the young man replied to the Venerable Ānanda. Rising from his seat, he went to where Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, was. Upon arriving, he told Subha, the student, son of Todeyya: "I have spoken to the Venerable Ānanda in accordance with your words: 'Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, asks the Venerable Ānanda whether he is free from illness, free from disease, of light frame, strong, and living in comfort,' and he further says: 'It would be good if the Venerable Ānanda would visit the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.'"

When this was said, sir, the ascetic Ānanda told me: 'It is an unsuitable time, young man.

Today I have taken some medicine.

Perhaps tomorrow we might come, depending on the right time and occasion.'

Even to this extent, sir, what was rightly done, since the Venerable Ānanda made an opportunity for visiting even on the following day?"

448. Then, as that night passed, the Venerable Ānanda, having dressed in the early morning, taking his bowl and robe, went with the Venerable Cetaka, a monk acting as his attendant, to the dwelling of Subha, the student, son of Todeyya. Upon arriving, he sat down on the prepared seat.

Then Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, went to where the Venerable Ānanda was, and upon arriving, exchanged friendly greetings with the Venerable Ānanda.

Having concluded the courteous and amiable conversation, he sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, Subha, the student, son of Todeyya, said to the Venerable Ānanda: "The Venerable Ānanda was for a long time the Blessed Gotama's attendant, dwelling in his presence and nearby.

The Venerable Ānanda would know which teachings the Blessed Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, trained, and established this populace.

Which teachings, Venerable Ānanda, were praised by the Blessed Gotama, and in which did he encourage, train, and establish this populace?"

449. "Subha, the Blessed One praised three aggregates, and in these he encouraged, trained, and established this populace:

Which three? The aggregate of noble morality (ariya sīlakkhandha), the aggregate of noble concentration (ariya samādhikkhandha), and the aggregate of noble wisdom (ariya paññākkhandha).

The Blessed One praised these three aggregates, Subha, and in these he encouraged, trained, and established this populace." Just as if, young man, a person were to draw out a reed from its sheath.
He would think: ‘This is the reed, this is the sheath; the reed is one thing, the sheath another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’
Or as if, young man, a person were to draw a sword from its scabbard.
He would think: ‘This is the sword; this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’
Or as if, young man, a person were to pull a snake out from its slough.
He would think: ‘This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake is one, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has been pulled out.’
In the same way, young man, a *bhikkhu* … and also, young man, when a *bhikkhu*’s mind is thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilements, softened, workable, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the creation of a mind-made body (*manomayaṃ kāyaṃ* )…
This comes to him through wisdom (*paññāya*).
474.
"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power (*iddhividhāya*).
He enjoys various supernormal powers (*anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ*).
Being one, he becomes many; being many, he becomes one.
He appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space.
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water.
He walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land.
Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird.
He even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are.
He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahmā-world.
"Just as if, young man, a skilled potter or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared clay whatever kind of vessel he might desire.
Or just as if, young man, a skilled ivory-worker or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared ivory whatever kind of ivory work he might desire.
Or just as if, young man, a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared gold whatever kind of gold work he might desire.
In the same way, young man, Bhikkhu…pe… Furthermore, Māṇava, the monk, with mind thus concentrated, purified, and cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilements, softened, workable, steady, attained to imperturbability, directs and applies his mind to the various kinds of psychic power (iddhi-vidhā).

He experiences the various kinds of psychic power (iddhi-vidhā): Being one, he becomes many…pe… he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.

This comes to him through wisdom (paññā).

475.

"So, with mind thus concentrated…pe… attained to imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the divine ear-element (dibba-sota-dhātu).

With the divine ear-element (dibba-sota-dhātu), purified and surpassing the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far and near.

Just as, Māṇava, a man is traveling along a road.

He might hear the sound of a kettledrum (bheri-sadda), a small drum (mudiṅga-sadda), a conch (saṅkha), a cymbal (paṇava), or a kettle-drum (dindima-sadda).

It would occur to him, ‘This is the sound of a kettledrum (bheri-sadda), this is the sound of a small drum (mudiṅga-sadda), this is the sound of a conch (saṅkha), a cymbal (paṇava), or a kettle-drum (dindima-sadda)’.

In the same way, Māṇava, a bhikkhu…pe….

Furthermore, Māṇava, the monk, with mind thus concentrated…pe… attained to imperturbability, directs and applies his mind to the divine ear-element (dibba-sota-dhātu).

With the divine ear-element (dibba-sota-dhātu), purified and surpassing the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far and near.

This comes to him through wisdom (paññā).

476.

"So, with mind thus concentrated, purified and cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilements, softened, workable, steady, attained to imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the knowledge of penetration of the minds of others (ceto-pariya-ñāṇa).

He knows and understands with his own mind the minds of other beings and other individuals. He understands a mind with lust (sarāga) as a mind with lust (sarāga), and a mind without lust (vītarāga) as a mind without lust (vītarāga); he understands a mind with hate (sadosa) as a mind with hate (sadosa), and a mind without hate (vītadosa) as a mind without hate (vītadosa); he understands a mind with delusion (samoha) as a mind with delusion (samoha), and a mind without delusion (vītamoha) as a mind without delusion (vītamoha); he understands a contracted mind (saṅkhitta) as a contracted mind (saṅkhitta), and a distracted mind (vikkhitta) as a distracted mind (vikkhitta); he understands an exalted mind (mahaggata) as an exalted mind (mahaggata), and an unexalted mind (amahaggata) as an unexalted mind (amahaggata); he understands a surpassable mind (sauttara) as a surpassable mind (sauttara), and an unsurpassed mind (anuttara) as an unsurpassed mind (anuttara); he understands a concentrated mind (samāhita) as a concentrated mind (samāhita), and an unconcentrated mind (asamāhita) as an unconcentrated mind (asamāhita); He understands liberated mind as liberated mind (vimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuttaṃ citta’nti pajānāti), and unliberated mind as unliberated mind (avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ avimuttaṃ citta’nti pajānāti).

"Just as, young man, a woman or a man, young and fond of ornaments, examining their own facial reflection in a pure bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water, would know, if there were a spot, 'It has a spot,' and if there were no spot, 'It has no spot.'

In the same way, young man, a monk… directs his mind to the knowledge of encompassing the minds… because when his mind is thus concentrated… and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of encompassing the minds.

He discerns the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust… and an unliberated mind as unliberated.

That is known to him by wisdom (idampissa hoti paññāya).

"When his mind is thus concentrated and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of recollecting past lives (pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇa).

He recollects his numerous past lives (anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati).

That is, one birth (ekampi jātiṃ), two births (dvepi jātiyo), three births (tissopi jātiyo), four births (catassopi jātiyo), five births (pañcapi jātiyo), ten births (dasapi jātiyo), twenty births (vīsampi jātiyo), thirty births (tiṃsampi jātiyo), forty births (cattālīsampi jātiyo), fifty births (paññāsampi jātiyo), a hundred births (jātisatampi), a thousand births (jātisahassampi), a hundred thousand births (jātisatasahassampi), many aeons of world-contraction (anekepi saṃvaṭṭakappe), many aeons of world-expansion (anekepi vivaṭṭakappe), many aeons of world-contraction and expansion (anekepi saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappe): ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term.

Passing away from there, I arose there. There too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’

Thus he remembers various past births, their conditions and details (iti sākāraṃ sauddesaṃ anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarati).

"Just as, young man, a man might go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village, and then from that village he would return to his own village.

He would think to himself: ‘I went from my own village to that village. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way.

From that village I went to still another village. There too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way.

From that village I returned to my own village.’

In the same way, young man, a monk… Thus, with the mind well-concentrated… and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind towards the knowledge of the recollection of past lives.
He recollects his manifold past lives.
That is to say: one birth… Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.
That is known to him by wisdom (paññā).
478.
“When his mind is thus concentrated… and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.
With the divine eye (dibbaṃ cakkhu), which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their *karma*, thus: ‘These beings— who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones (*ariyas*), held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—
at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.
But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, who held right view and acted accordingly,
at the breaking up of the body after death, they are reborn in a good destination, a heaven world.’
Thus with the divine eye (dibbaṃ cakkhu), purified and surpassing that of humans, he sees beings passing away and re-arising, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions.
"Just as, *Māṇava*, there might be a palace in the middle of a crossroads, and a man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house, walking in the street, or sitting in the middle of the crossroads.
He would think to himself: ‘Those people are entering the house, those are leaving it, those are walking along the streets, and those are sitting in the central square.’
In the same way, *Māṇava*, a *bhikkhu*… and attained to imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.
With the divine eye (dibbaṃ cakkhu), which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one understands how beings pass on according to their actions.
That is known to him by wisdom (paññā).

“When his mind is thus concentrated, purified and bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, He directs and inclines his mind towards the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions.

He understands, as it actually is: “This is suffering ( *dukkha*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the origin of suffering (*dukkha*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the cessation of suffering (*dukkha*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering (*dukkha*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “These are the taints (*āsava*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the origin of the taints (*āsava*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the cessation of the taints (*āsava*)”, he understands, as it actually is: “This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints (*āsava*)”.

When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire (*kāmāsava*), from the taint of existence (*bhavāsava*), and from the taint of ignorance (*avijjāsava*). When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It’s liberated.’

He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth (*jāti*), the spiritual life (*brahmacariya*) has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’

"Just as if, Māṇava, there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and undisturbed.

There a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells and gravel, and shoals of fish, both moving and still.

He might think: ‘This lake is clear, limpid, and undisturbed.

There are these shells, this gravel, and these shoals of fish, both moving and still.’

In the same way, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu*… and also, Māṇava, a *bhikkhu* with mind concentrated directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions.

He understands, as it actually is: “This is suffering (*dukkha*)”… he understands, as it actually is: “This is the path leading to the cessation of the taints (*āsava*)”.

When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire (*kāmāsava*), from the taint of existence (*bhavāsava*), and from the taint of ignorance (*avijjāsava*). When it is liberated, the knowledge arises: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth (*jāti*), the spiritual life (*brahmacariya*) has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’

This comes to him through wisdom (*paññā*).

480.

"That, Māṇava, is the division of Ariyan wisdom (*paññākkhandha*) which the Lord praised, with which he aroused, exhorted and established these people.

Beyond that there is nothing to be done."

"It is wonderful, Ānanda, it is marvelous, Ānanda! This division of Ariyan wisdom (*paññākkhandha*) is perfectly fulfilled, not left incomplete.

And I do not see this division of Ariyan wisdom (*paññākkhandha*) fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics (*samaṇa*) and Brahmins (*brāhmaṇa*) of other schools. The Virtue Category
450.
"Well, Reverend Ānanda, what is the noble virtue category ( *ariya sīlakkhandho* ) which the Reverend Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, established, and grounded this populace?"
"Here, young sir ( *māṇava* ), a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *arahaṃ*, a fully enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), endowed with knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugato*, knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed trainer of those to be tamed (*anuttaro purisadammasārathi*), teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), the Awakened One ( *buddho* ), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*).
He, having realized it by his own super-knowledge (*abhiññā*), proclaims this world with its gods (*sadevakaṃ*), *Māras* (*samārakaṃ*) and *Brahmās* (*sabrahmakaṃ*), its ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ*), its princes and people (*pajaṃ*), with its gods and humans (*sadevamanussaṃ*).
He teaches the *Dhamma* that is good in the beginning (*ādikalyāṇaṃ*), good in the middle (*majjhekalyāṇaṃ*), and good in the end (*pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ*), with its meaning (*sātthaṃ*) and with its wording (*sabyañjanaṃ*), perfectly complete (*kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ*), thoroughly pure (*parisuddhaṃ*), he reveals the holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ pakāseti*).
A householder (*gahapati*) or a householder’s son (*gahapatiputto*) or one born in some other clan hears that *Dhamma*.
Having heard this *Dhamma*, he gains faith (*saddhaṃ*) in the *Tathāgata*.
He, endowed with that gaining of faith (*saddhāpaṭilābhena samannāgato*), reflects thus: ‘The household life is crowded, a dusty path; the ascetic life is open. It is not easy, while living in a house, to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly pure holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ*) like a polished shell.’
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyya’nti*)?’
Then, at a later time, having abandoned a small or a large fortune ( *bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya*), having abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives (*ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya*), he shaves off his hair and beard (*kesamassuṃ ohāretvā*), puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā*), and goes forth from the home life into homelessness (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati*).
Having thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the *Pātimokkha-saṃvara*, possessed of proper behavior and resort (*ācāragocarasampanno*), seeing danger in the slightest faults (*anumattesu vajjesu bhayadassāvī*), undertaking the training (*sikkhā*) in the rules of training (*sikkhāpadesu*), endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action (*kāyakammavacīkammena samannāgato kusalena*), his livelihood is purified (*parisuddhājīvo*), he is possessed of moral discipline (*sīlasampanno*), with the sense-doors guarded (*indriyesu guttadvāro*), endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena samannāgato*), and is content (*santuṭṭho*).
451.
"And how, young sir (*māṇava*), is a *bhikkhu* accomplished in virtue ( *sīlasampanno* )? Here, young sir ( *māṇava* ), a *bhikkhu*, abandoning the killing of living beings (*pāṇātipātaṃ pahāya*), abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti*); with rod and weapon laid aside (*nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*), gentle and kindly (*lajjī dayāpanno*), he abides compassionate to all living beings (*sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī viharati*).
Indeed, young sir (*māṇava*), a *bhikkhu*, abandoning the killing of living beings (*pāṇātipātaṃ pahāya*), abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti*); with rod and weapon laid aside (*nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*), gentle and kindly (*lajjī dayāpanno*). He dwells, full of compassion for the welfare of all living beings; this also pertains to his moral discipline.

(This should be elaborated as in sections 194 to 210).

"Or he might say: ‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as: performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings, practicing demonology, working spells to cause abundance, inducing virility, inducing impotence, preparing and consecrating sites for houses, performing ceremonial mouthwashes, performing ceremonial bathing, offering sacrificial fires, administering emetics, administering purgatives, administering expectorants, administering downward-acting purgatives, administering head-cleansing remedies, administering ear-oil, administering eye-salves, performing nasal treatments, applying medicinal ointments, applying counter-ointments, practicing eye-surgery, practicing surgery, practicing children's medicine, dispensing root medicines, and dispensing herbal medicines.’ Thus he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

Even so, Māṇava, a monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood whereby some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living, such as performing propitiatory rites, vowing offerings…pe…dispensing herbal medicines.

This also pertains to his moral discipline.

452.

"That is he [this is he (ka.)], Māṇava, a monk who is thus perfected in morality and sees no danger from any side, owing to his being restrained by morality.

Just as, Māṇava, a Khattiya king who has been consecrated by sprinkling water on his head, having defeated his enemies, sees no danger from any side because of his adversaries.

Even so, Māṇava, a monk who is thus perfected in morality sees no danger from any side, owing to his being restrained by morality.

Possessing this noble aggregate of moral discipline, he experiences within himself a blameless happiness.

Thus, Māṇava, a monk is perfected in morality.

453.

"This is the noble aggregate of moral discipline of which the Blessed One was a proponent, and in which he encouraged, established, and grounded this populace.

Something more remains to be done here."

"Amazing, venerable Ānanda, astounding, venerable Ānanda! This noble aggregate of moral discipline is perfectly complete, not incomplete.

And I do not see this perfectly complete noble aggregate of moral discipline anywhere outside of this, among other ascetics and Brahmins. I do not see.

And if any other ascetics and Brahmins outside of this world were to perceive the noble **category of virtue** (*ariyaṃ sīlakkhandhaṃ*) in themselves in this way, they would be delighted with just that much: "Enough has been done, enough has been done, we have attained the goal of asceticism (*sāmaññattho*), there is nothing more to do!"

And yet the Venerable Ānanda declares that there is more to be done! [Immediately after this...]

Concentration Category (*samādhikkhandho*)

454.

"What, Venerable Ānanda, is that noble Concentration Category (*ariyo samādhikkhandho*) which the Venerable Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, established, and grounded this populace?"

"And how, young man, is a monk one who guards the sense doors (*indriyesu guttadvāro*)? Here, young man, having seen a form with the eye, a monk is neither a grasper of signs (*nimittaggāhī*) nor a grasper of details (*anubyañjanaggāhī*). Because if he were to dwell with the eye faculty (*cakkhundriyaṃ*) unrestrained, evil, unskillful qualities of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes restraint of the eye faculty.

Having heard a sound with the ear... Having smelled an odor with the nose... Having tasted a taste with the tongue... Having felt a tactile object with the body... Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is neither a grasper of signs (*nimittaggāhī*) nor a grasper of details (*anubyañjanaggāhī*). Because if he were to dwell with the mind faculty (*manindriyaṃ*) unrestrained, evil, unskillful qualities of covetousness and grief might invade him, he practices for its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes restraint of the mind faculty.

Endowed with this noble restraint of the faculties (*indriyasaṃvarena*), he experiences within himself the blameless bliss (*abyāsekasukhaṃ*).

In this way, young man, a monk is one who guards the sense doors (*indriyesu guttadvāro*).

455.

"And how, young man, is a monk endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena*)? Here, young man, when going forward and backward, a monk acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in looking forward and back, he acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in bending and stretching, he acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in wearing his inner and outer robe and bowl, he acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in eating, drinking, chewing and savoring, he acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in passing excrement or urine, he acts with clear awareness (*sampajānakārī*); in walking, standing, While going, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, talking, and maintaining silence, he is one who practises with full awareness.

In this way, young man, the *bhikkhu* is accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness.

456.

"And how, young man, is a *bhikkhu* content? Here, young man, a *bhikkhu* is content with robes to protect his body (*kāyaparihārikena cīvarena*) and almsfood to sustain his belly (*kucchiparihārikena piṇḍapātena*).

Wherever he goes he sets out taking only along with him.

Just as a bird, young man, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too, young man, the *bhikkhu* becomes content with robes to protect his body (*kāyaparihārikena cīvarena*) and with almsfood to maintain his stomach (*kucchiparihārikena piṇḍapātena*).

Wherever he goes he sets out taking only along with him.

In this way, young man, the *bhikkhu* is content.

457.

"Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline (*arīyena sīlakkhandhena samannāgato*), with this noble restraint over the sense faculties (*arīyena indriyasaṃvarena samannāgato*), with this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension (*arīyena satisampajaññena samannāgato*), and with this noble contentment (*arīyāya santuṭṭhiyā samannāgato*), he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest (*araññaṃ*), the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūlaṃ*), a mountain (*pabbataṃ*), a glen (*kandaraṃ*), a hillside cave (*giriguhaṃ*), a cremation ground (*susānaṃ*), a jungle grove (*vanapatthaṃ*), the open air (*abbhokāsaṃ*), a heap of straw (*palālapuñjaṃ*).

Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round (*piṇḍapātappaṭikkanto*), he sits down cross-legged (*pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā*), holding his body erect (*ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya*), having established mindfulness before him (*parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā*).

458.

"Abandoning covetousness for the world (*abhijjhaṃ loke pahāya*), he abides with a mind free from covetousness (*vigatābhijjhena cetasā viharati*); he purifies his mind from covetousness (*abhijjhāya cittaṃ parisodheti*).

Abandoning ill will and hatred (*byāpādapadosaṃ pahāya*), he abides with a mind free from ill will (*abyāpannacitto viharati*), compassionate for the welfare of all living beings (*sabbapāṇabhūtahitānukampī*); he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred (*byāpādapadosā cittaṃ parisodheti*).

Abandoning sloth and torpor (*thinamiddhaṃ pahāya*), he abides free from sloth and torpor (*vigatathinamiddho viharati*), percipient of light (*ālokasaññī*), mindful and fully aware (*sato sampajāno*); he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor (*thinamiddhā cittaṃ parisodheti*).

Abandoning restlessness and remorse (*uddhaccakukkuccaṃ pahāya*), he abides unagitated (*anuddhhato viharati*) with a mind inwardly peaceful (*ajjhattaṃ vūpasantacitto*); he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse (*uddhaccakukkuccā cittaṃ parisodheti*).

Abandoning doubt (*vicikicchaṃ pahāya*), he abides having gone beyond doubt (*tiṇṇavicikiccho viharati*), unperplexed about wholesome states (*akathaṃkathī kusalesu dhammesu*); he purifies his mind from doubt (*vicikicchāya cittaṃ parisodheti*).

459.

"Just as, young man, a man were to take a loan (*iṇaṃ ādāya*) and apply it to his business (*kammante payojeyya*).

And his business were to succeed (*kammantā samijjheyyuṃ*),

so that he could pay back his old debts (*iṇamūlāni byantiṃ kareyya*), and there would remain enough extra to maintain a wife (*dārabharaṇāya*);

he might think: “Before this I developed my business by borrowing (*iṇaṃ ādāya kammante payojesiṃ*).

And my business succeeded (*kammantā samijjhiṃsu*).

And I have been able to pay back all the money of the old loan (*iṇamūlāni byantiṃ akāsiṃ*), and there is enough extra to maintain my wife (*dārabharaṇāyā’ti*).

Then as a result he would become glad (*pāmojjaṃ labhetha*) and experience joy (*somanassaṃ adhigaccheyya*).

460.

"Just as, young man, a man were to become sick (*ābādhiko assa*), afflicted (*dukkhito*), gravely ill (*bāḷhagilāno*), so that he could not enjoy his food (*bhattañcassa nacchādeyya*) and his strength would decline (*kāye balamattā*).

After some time he would recover from that illness (*ābādhā mucceyya*) and would enjoy his food (*bhattañcassa chādeyya*) and regain his bodily strength (*kāye balamattā*).

He might think: “Before this I was sick (*ābādhiko ahosiṃ*), afflicted (*dukkhito*), gravely ill (*bāḷhagilāno*), so that I could not enjoy my food (*bhattañca me nacchādesi*) and my bodily strength had declined (*kāye balamattā*).

But now I have recovered from that illness (*ābādhā mutto*) and I enjoy my food (*bhattañca me chādeti*) and my bodily strength has returned (*kāye balamattā*)”.

Then as a result he would become glad (*pāmojjaṃ labhetha*) and experience joy (*somanassaṃ adhigaccheyya*).

461.

"Just as, young man, a man might be bound in prison (*bandhanāgāre baddho assa*).

After some time he would be released from prison (*bandhanāgārā mucceyya*), safe and secure (*sotthinā abbhayena*), with no loss of his possessions (*bhogānaṃ vayo*).

He might think: “Before this I was bound in prison (*bandhanāgāre baddho ahosiṃ*).

But now I have been released from that prison (*bandhanāgārā mutto*), safe and secure (*sotthinā abbhayena*), and there has been no loss of my possessions (*bhogānaṃ vayo*)”.

Then as a result he would become glad (*pāmojjaṃ labhetha*) and experience joy (*somanassaṃ adhigaccheyya*).

462.

"Just as, young man, a man were a slave (*dāso assa*), without independence (*anattādhīno*), subservient to others (*parādhīno*), unable to go where he wants (*yenakāmaṃgamo*).
After some time, he would be released from that slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a free man able to go where he wants.

He might think, 'Before this, I was a slave, not self-dependent, dependent on others, not free to go where I wanted.'

'Now, at this time, I am freed from that slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a free man able to go where I want.'

As a result of that, he would obtain joy (*prāmojjaṃ*), he would experience gladness (*saumanassaṃ*).

463.

"Just as, *māṇava*, a man with wealth (*sadhano*) and possessions (*sabhogo*) might set out on a journey through a desert (*kantāraddhānamaggaṃ*) where food is scarce (*dubbhikkhaṃ*) and danger abounds (*sappaṭibhayaṃ*).

After some time, he would cross over that desert (*kantāraṃ*) and arrive safely (*sotthinā*) at the edge of a village (*gāmantaṃ*), secure (*khemaṃ*) and free from danger (*appaṭibhayaṃ*).

His Thus, he might think: “Before this, I, wealthy and prosperous, entered a desert road, a famine-stricken and dangerous place.

Now, I have safely crossed that desert, and I have safely reached the edge of a village, a secure and fearless place."

Then, on considering this, he would be glad and experience joy ( *pāmojjaṃ* and *somanassaṃ*).

464.

"In the same way, young man, when a *bhikkhu* sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned within himself, he regards that as a debt, as a sickness, as confinement in prison, as slavery, as a desert road (*kantāraddhānamaggaṃ*).

465.

"But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt (*āṇaṇyaṃ*), as good health (*ārogyaṃ*), as release from prison (*bandhanāmokkhaṃ*), as freedom from slavery (*bhujissaṃ*), as a place of safety (*khemantabhūmiṃ*).

In the same way, the *bhikkhu* sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself.

466.

"When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness (*pāmojjaṃ*) arises. When he is gladdened (*pamuditassa*), rapture (*pīti*) arises. When his mind is filled with rapture (*pītimanassa*), his body becomes tranquil (*passambhati*); tranquil in body (*passaddhakāyo*), he experiences happiness (*sukhaṃ vedeti*); being happy (*sukhino*), his mind becomes concentrated (*samādhiyati*).

467.

"Quite secluded from sensual pleasures (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome states (*akusalehi dhammehi*), he enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*), with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ*).

He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.

"Suppose, young man, a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice were to pour bath powder into a metal basin, sprinkle it with water, and knead it again and again.

The ball of bathing powder, imbued with moisture, saturated with moisture inside and out, is cohesive with moisture, and does not flow.

In the same way, young man, the *bhikkhu* drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.

Furthermore, young man, quite secluded from sensual pleasures (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome states (*akusalehi dhammehi*), a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the first *jhāna*, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*), with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ*).

He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this very body (*kāyaṃ*) with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion (*vivekajena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire so that there is no part of his body unpervaded by the happiness and joy born of seclusion.
This comes to him through concentration (samādhismiṃ).
468.
“Again, young man, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a *bhikṣu* enters upon and abides in the second *jhāna*, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha) born of concentration (samādhijaṃ).
He makes the rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha) born of concentration (samādhijena) drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body (kāyaṃ), so that there is no part of his whole body (kāyassa) unpervaded by the rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha) born of concentration (samādhijena).
“Just as, young man, there were a deep lake whose waters welled up from below.
It would have no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be replenished from time to time with showers of rain.
Then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water.
Even so, young man, a *bhikṣu*…pe… that which, young man, a *bhikṣu* with the subsiding of thinking and pondering…pe…enters and dwells in the second *jhāna*, he makes the rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha) born of concentration (samādhijena) drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body (kāyaṃ), so that there is no part of his whole body (kāyassa) unpervaded by the rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha) born of concentration (samādhijena).
This comes to him through concentration (samādhismiṃ).
469.
“Again, young man, with the fading away as well of rapture (pīti), a *bhikṣu* abides in equanimity (*upekkhako*), mindful (sato) and fully aware (sampajāno), still feeling pleasure (sukhaṃ) with the body (kāyena), he enters upon and dwells in the third *jhāna*, on account of which noble ones (ariyā) announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding (sukhavihārī) who has equanimity (upekkhako) and is mindful (satimā).’
He makes the pleasure (sukhena) divested of rapture (nippītikena) drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body (kāyaṃ), so that there is no part of his whole body (kāyassa) unpervaded by the pleasure (sukhena) divested of rapture (nippītikena).
“Just as, young man, in a pond of blue lotuses (*uppaliniyaṃ*) or red lotuses (*paduminiyaṃ*) or white lotuses (*puṇḍarīkiniyaṃ*), some blue lotuses (*uppalāni*) or red lotuses (*padumāni*) or white lotuses (*puṇḍarīkāni*) that are born in the water, grow in the water, thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their roots, so that there is no part of all those blue lotuses (*uppalānaṃ*) or red lotuses (*padumāni*) or white lotuses (*puṇḍarīkānaṃ*) or that it is unpervaded by the cool water.

Even so, young man, a *bhikkhu*... with the fading away as well of rapture... a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the third *jhāna*.

He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this happiness free from rapture, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.

This comes to him through concentration (*samādhi*).

470.

“Again, young man, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a *bhikkhu* enters upon and abides in the fourth *jhāna*, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity (*upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ*).

He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind.

“Just as though a man were sitting covered from head down with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth.

"That is the noble division of concentration (*samādhikkhandha*) which the Blessed One praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established this populace.

"It is wonderful, venerable Ānanda, it is amazing, venerable Ānanda! This division of noble concentration (*ariyo samādhikkhandho*) is perfectly fulfilled, not unfulfilled.

From this body, he creates another body, having form (*rūpiṃ*), mind-made (*manomayaṃ*), complete in all its parts, lacking no faculties (*ahīnindriyaṃ*). 2. The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship.
Account of the King's Ministers.
150. Thus have I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove, together with a large company of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus.
At that time, King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, having gone up to the roof of his palace, was sitting there surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day *uposatha*, the full-moon night of the fourth month, called Komudī.
Then King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, on that *uposatha* day, uttered this solemn utterance: ‘Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Lovely is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night!’
“Which ascetic or Brahmin should we visit tonight, that our mind might find peace in his presence?”
151. When this was said, one of the king's ministers said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Pūraṇa Kassapa, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
May Your Majesty visit this Pūraṇa Kassapa.
Perhaps by visiting Pūraṇa Kassapa, Your Majesty’s mind might find peace."
At these words King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, was silent.
152. Then another minister said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Makkhali Gosāla, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
May Your Majesty visit this Makkhali Gosāla.
Perhaps by visiting Makkhali Gosāla, Your Majesty’s mind might find peace."
At these words King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, was silent.
153. Then another minister said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Ajita Kesakambala, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
May Your Majesty visit this Ajita Kesakambala.
Perhaps by visiting Ajita Kesakambala, Your Majesty’s mind might find peace."
At these words King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, was silent.
154. Then another minister said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Pakudha Kaccāyana, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
May Your Majesty visit this Pakudha Kaccāyana.
Perhaps by visiting Pakudha Kaccāyana, Your Majesty’s mind might find peace."
At these words King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, was silent.
155. Then another minister said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
May Your Majesty visit this Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta.
Perhaps by visiting Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Your Majesty’s mind might find peace."
At these words King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha, was silent.
156. Then another minister said to King Ajātasattu, the son of Queen Vedehī, of Magadha: "Your majesty, there is Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well-known and famous, a spiritual leader whom many people esteem as holy, aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life.
...Nātaputta (Pī.)...
He is the head of an order ( *saṃghī*), the leader of a group (*gaṇī*), the teacher of a group (*gaṇācariyo*), well-known (*ñāto*), famous (*yasassī*), the founder of a school (*titthakaro*), highly respected (*sādhusammato*) by many people (*bahujanassa*), experienced (*rattaññū*), long gone forth (*cirapabbajito*), aged (*addhagato*), advanced in years (*vayoanuppatto*).
May Your Majesty visit the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta.
Perhaps, indeed, Your Majesty... But I don’t think so. I don’t not say it is not.
‘Isn’t there another world? … ‘Both? … ‘Neither? … ‘Are there beings spontaneously reborn? … ‘Are there not…? “Both…? “Neither…? “Is there fruit and result of good and bad deeds? … ‘Isn’t there? … ‘Both? … ‘Neither? … ‘Does the *Tathāgata* exist after death? Does he not exist after death? Does he both exist and not exist after death? Does he neither exist nor not exist after death? .. ,”64 “If I thought so, I would say so. . . I don’t say it is not.”
But do I not say “It is this way,” nor “It is that way,” nor “It is otherwise.” I do not say “It is not so,” nor do I say “It is not not so.”’

181. "Thus, venerable sir, Sañjaya Belatthaputta, on being asked about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me evasively.
Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Sañjaya Belatthaputta about a visible fruit of recluseship, he answered me evasively.
And I thought: “Of all these ascetics and *Brāhmaṇas*, Sañjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused.
How should one, when asked about the visible fruit of recluseship, answer evasively?”
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse or *Brahmin* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Sañjaya Belatthaputta nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.
The first visible fruit of recluseship.

182. “So, venerable sir, I ask the Blessed One also: Just as these various crafts, such as elephant trainers, horse trainers, charioteers, Archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, army caterers, champions and senior officers, scouts, heroes, mail-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bathmen, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, statisticians, accountants, and whatever other various crafts there are, they enjoy here and now the visible fruit of their craft. By that they gladden and delight themselves, they gladden and delight their mothers and fathers, they gladden and delight their children and wives, they gladden and delight their friends and colleagues, they establish an uplifting offering to ascetics and Brahmins, which leads to heaven, resulting in happiness and conducing to rebirth in heaven.

“Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any fruit of the ascetic life that is similarly visible here and now?”

183.
“It is possible, great king.”

“Well then, great king, I will question you about this very matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a man, a slave, a worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to your wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please you.

The thought might occur to him: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvelous, the destiny and result of meritorious deeds! This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is a human being, and I too am a human being. This King Ajātasattu, the son of Vedehi, is endowed and furnished with the five strands of sensual pleasure, he enjoys himself, I think, like a god. But I am his slave, his worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to his wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please him. I ought to do something meritorious!

What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

After some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having gone forth in this way, he lives restrained in body, restrained in speech, restrained in mind, content with the bare necessities of food and clothing, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: ‘Your Majesty should know, that man, your slave, your worker, rising up early, retiring late, obedient to your wishes, acting agreeably, speaking kindly, always looking to please you—that man, Your Majesty, has shaved off his hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness.’" Having gone forth, he dwells restrained in body ( *kāyena saṃvuto viharati*), speech (*vācāya saṃvuto viharati*), and mind (*manasā saṃvuto viharati*), content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.
Would you say: ‘Bring that man back to me, men. Let him again become my slave, my workman, rising before me, retiring after me, doing whatever I want, acting always for my pleasure, speaking politely to me, ever on the lookout to see that I am satisfied.’?”

184. "Certainly not, venerable sir."
Then we should pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes (*cīvara*), almsfood (*piṇḍapāta*), dwelling (*senāsana*), and medicinal requirements (*gilānappaccayabhesajjaparikkhārehi*). And we would provide him with righteous protection, defense, and security."
185. "What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of recluseship (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*)?” “Certainly, venerable sir, if such is the case, there is a visible fruit of recluseship (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*)."
“This, great king, is the first fruit of recluseship, visible here and now (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*), that I point out to you."
The second visible fruit of recluseship (*dutiyasandiṭṭhikasāmaññaphalaṃ*).
186. "Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out some other fruit of recluseship visible here and now (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ* )?” “It is possible, great king.
Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.
Answer as you see fit.
What do you think, great king? Suppose there is a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
He might think: “It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds (*puññānaṃ gati, puññānaṃ vipāko*)!
For this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*), is a human being (*manusso*), and I too am a human being (*manusso*).
Yet this King Ajātaśatru (*ajātasattu*) of Magadha (*māgadho*), son of Vedehi (*vedehiputto*) enjoys himself fully endowed and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure (*pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappito samaṅgībhūto paricāreti*) as if he were a god, I think.
Whereas I am a farmer (*kassako*), a householder (*gahapatiko*), who pays taxes (*karakārako*), who increases his wealth (*rāsivaḍḍhako*).
I ought to do something meritorious (*puññāni kareyyaṃ*).
What if I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’
"After some time, he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small, abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes (*kāsāyāni vatthāni*), and He would go forth from home into homelessness.

And he, having thus gone forth, might dwell restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.

And if people were to announce to you: “Sire, you remember that man. .. who was a farmer, a householder, who paid taxes to maintain the royal revenue; that man, O king, has shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, and has gone forth from his home into the homeless life.”

And he, having thus gone forth, lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.”

Would you then say: “That man must come back and be a steward as before”?

187.

“Certainly not, venerable sir.

Rather, we would pay homage to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, and invite him to accept from us robes, almsfood, dwelling, and medicinal requirements. And we would provide him with righteous protection, defense, and security.”

188.

“What do you think, great king? If such is the case, is there or is there not a visible fruit of the ascetic life?” “Assuredly, venerable sir, if such is the case, there is a visible fruit of the ascetic life.”

“This, great king, is the second fruit of the ascetic life, visible here and now, that I point out to you.”

A more excellent fruit of the ascetic life

189.

“Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out any other fruit of the ascetic life visible here and now, more excellent and sublime than these two fruits?” “It is possible, great king.

Then listen, great king, and attend carefully, I will speak.”

“Yes, venerable sir,” King Ajātasattu, son of the Videhi queen, replied to the Blessed One.

190.

The Blessed One spoke: “Herein, great king, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, a worthy one, perfectly enlightened, endowed with clear knowledge and conduct, accomplished, a knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and exalted.

He

makes known—having realized it through direct knowledge—this world with its gods, *Māras*, & *Brahmās*, its generations with their contemplatives & brahmans, their rulers & commonfolk;

He teaches the *Dhamma* admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; he expounds the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.”

191.

“That *Dhamma* is heard by a householder or householder’s son, or one reborn in some family or other.

On hearing the *Dhamma* he acquires faith in the *Tathāgata*.

Endowed with such faith, he reflects: ‘The household life is crowded, a path of dust. Going forth is like the open air.

It is not easy for one dwelling at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly purified holy life, bright as a polished conch.

Suppose I were to shave off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?’

192.

“After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness.

193.

“When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the *Pātimokkha*, possessed of proper behavior and resort. Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he is possessed of moral discipline. He guards the doors of his sense faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is content.

Lesser morality

194.

“And how, great king, is a *bhikkhu* perfected in morality? Herein, great king, having abandoned the destruction of life, the *bhikkhu* abstains from the destruction of life.

He has laid down the rod and weapon and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings.

Thus he is perfected in morality. He abstains from accepting cocks and pigs.
He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses and mares.
He abstains from accepting fields and plots.
He abstains from running errands.
He abstains from buying and selling.
He abstains from cheating with false weights, false metals, and false measures.
“He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, deception, and fraud.
“He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, robbery, plunder, and violence.
This pertains to his moral discipline.
The Lesser Morality is finished.
The Middle Morality

195.
“Whereas some venerable ascetics and Brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, are addicted to continually causing damage to seed and plant life—
Specifically: as are propagated from roots, from stems, from joints, from cuttings, from seeds, the he refrains from such destruction.
This pertains to his moral discipline.

I understand this *dhamma-vinaya*. How can you understand this *dhamma-vinaya*? You are practicing wrongly. I am practicing rightly. I am consistent. You are inconsistent. What should have been said first, you said last; what should have been said last, you said first. What you took so long to think out has been refuted. Your doctrine has been refuted.

as arranging the giving and taking in marriage, engagements and divorces; declaring the time for saving and spending, bringing good or bad luck, procuring abortions, using spells to bind the tongue, binding the jaw, making the hands jerk, causing deafness, getting answers with a mirror, a girl-medium, a *deva*; worshipping the sun or Great *Brahmā*, breathing fire, invoking the goddess of luck—he abstains from such wrong means of livelihood, from such debased arts. This pertains to his moral discipline.

211.
"Or he might say: ‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts and making a living.
As follows: appeasing the deities (**_santikammaṃ_**), redeeming vows to them (**_paṇidhikammaṃ_**), demonology (**_bhūtakammaṃ_**), inducing virility (**_bhūrikammaṃ_**) or impotence, preparing and consecrating building sites (**_vassakammaṃ_**), giving ritual rinsings (**_ācamanaṃ_**) and bathings (**_nhāpanaṃ_**), making sacrifices (**_juhanaṃ_**), giving emetics (**_vamanaṃ_**), purges (**_virecanaṃ_**), expectorants (**_uddhaṃvirecanaṃ_**) and phlegmagogues (**_adhovirecanaṃ_**), giving ear-medicine (**_kaṇṇatelaṃ_**), eye-medicine (**_netta_tappanaṃ_**), nose-medicine (**_natthukammaṃ_**), ointments (**_añjanaṃ_**) and counter-ointments (**_paccañjanaṃ_**), eye-surgery (**_sālākiyaṃ_**), surgery (**_sallakattiyaṃ_**), pediatrics (**_dārakatikicchā_**), using balms to counter the side-effects of previous remedies (**_mūlabhesajjānaṃ anuppadānaṃ_**), a monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood.

This pertains to his morality.

212.

"And then, great king, that *bhikkhu* who is thus perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality (*_sīlasaṃvarato_**).*

Just as a head-anointed noble warrior (*_khattiyo muddhābhisitto_**) who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, so the *bhikkhu* who is thus possessed of moral discipline sees no danger anywhere in regard to his restraint by moral discipline.

Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue (*_ariya sīlakkhandha_**), he experiences within himself a bliss that is blameless (*_anavajjasukhaṃ_**).

In this way, great king, the *bhikkhu* is possessed of moral discipline.

The great section on morality is finished.

Restraint of the Senses (*_indriyasaṃvaro_*)

213.

"And how, great king, does the *bhikkhu* guard the doors of his senses (**_indriyesu guttadvāro hoti_**)? Herein, great king, having seen a form with the eye (*_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā_*), the *bhikkhu* does not grasp at the sign (*_nimittaggāhī_*) or the details (**_anubyañjanaggāhī_**).

Since if he left the eye faculty unrestrained (**_cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ_**), bad, unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices restraint over it, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty.

On hearing a sound with the ear, … on smelling an odour with the nose, … on tasting a flavour with the tongue, … on feeling an object with the body, … on cognizing a mind-object with the mind, the *bhikkhu* does not grasp at the sign or the details.

Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind (**_manindriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ_**), evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind.

Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties (*_ariyena indriyasaṃvarena samannāgato_**), he experiences within himself a bliss that is unsullied (*_abyāsekasukhaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti_**).

In this way, great king, the *bhikkhu* guards the doors of the sense faculties.

Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension (*_satisampajaññaṃ_*)

214.

"And how, great king, is the *bhikkhu* endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*_satisampajaññena samannāgato hoti_* )? Herein, great king, in going forward and returning, the *bhikkhu* acts with clear comprehension (*_sampajānakārī hoti_**). In looking ahead and looking aside, he acts with clear comprehension. In bending and stretching the limbs, he acts with clear comprehension. In wearing his robes and cloak and using his almsbowl, he acts with clear comprehension. In eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting, he acts with clear comprehension. In defecating and urinating, he acts with clear comprehension. In going, standing, sitting, lying down, sleeping, waking, speaking, and remaining silent, he acts with clear comprehension.

In this way, great king, the *bhikkhu* is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.

Contentment (*_santoso_*)

215.

"And how, great king, is the *bhikkhu* content (*_santuṭṭho hoti_* )? Herein, great king, a *bhikkhu* is content with robes to protect his body (**_kāyaparihārikena cīvarena_**) and almsfood to sustain his belly (**_kucchiparihārikena piṇḍapātena_**).

Wherever he goes he sets out taking only along with him.

Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden,

in the same way a *bhikkhu* is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly.

Wherever he goes he sets out taking only along with him.

In this way, great king, the *bhikkhu* is content.

Abandonment of the Hindrances (*_nīvaraṇappahānaṃ_*)

216.

"Then he, equipped with this noble aggregate of morality (*_ariyena sīlakkhandhena samannāgato_**), with this noble restraint of the senses (**_ariyena indriyasaṃvarena samannāgato_**), with this noble mindfulness and full awareness (*_ariyena satisampajaññena samannāgato_**), and with this noble contentment (**_ariyāya santuṭṭhiyā samannāgato_**), finds a solitary lodging (**_vivittaṃ senāsanaṃ bhajati_**), at the root of a forest tree, in a mountain cave or gorge, a charnel-ground, a jungle-thicket, or in the open air on a heap of straw.

After returning from his almsround, following his meals, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him.

217.

"Abandoning hankering for the world (**_abhijjhaṃ loke pahāya_**), he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering, and his mind is purified of it.

Abandoning ill will and hatred (**_byāpādapadosaṃ pahāya_**). ‘He may well bring peace to the mind by visiting Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.’

When this was said, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, was silent.

The story of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.

157.

At that time, Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, said this to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “But why are you silent, friend Jīvaka?”

“This Blessed One, worthy and perfectly enlightened, is staying in our mango grove with a large Saṃgha of monks, with thirteen hundred monks.

This good report about that Blessed One [Blessed One Gotama] has spread thus: ‘Indeed, that Blessed One is an Arhat, a fully enlightened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of the world, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’

May Your Majesty visit that Blessed One.

Perhaps if you visit the Blessed One, it might bring peace to your mind."

158.

“Then, friend Jīvaka, have the elephant vehicles prepared."

"Yes, your majesty," Jīvaka Komārabhacca replied to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen. Having had five hundred she-elephants prepared and also a royal elephant, he reported to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen: "Your Majesty, the elephant vehicles are ready. Now is the time to do as you think fit.”

159.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, had a woman mounted on each of the five hundred she-elephants, mounted the royal elephant, and went forth from Rājagaha in great royal magnificence with torches being carried, in the direction of Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s mango grove.

Then, when King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, was not far from the mango grove, fear arose in him, trepidation arose, and terror arose.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, frightened and agitated, with his hair standing on end, said this to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Are you not deceiving me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not tricking me, friend Jīvaka? Are you not handing me over to my enemies, friend Jīvaka? Why would there be no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no noise, in such a large Saṃgha of monks, of thirteen hundred monks?"

“Do not fear, Great King, do not fear, Great King.

I am not deceiving you, Your Majesty; I am not tricking you, Your Majesty; I am not handing you over to your enemies, Your Majesty.

Go forward, Great King, go forward, Great King. There are lights burning in the round pavilion.”

The Questions on the Fruits of Asceticism

160.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, went by elephant as far as the ground was suitable for the elephant, dismounted from the elephant, and approached the door of the round pavilion on foot. Having approached, he said this to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: “Where, friend Jīvaka, is the Blessed One?”

“Here, Great King, is the Blessed One. Here, Great King, is the Blessed One, leaning against the middle pillar, facing east, surrounded by the Saṃgha of monks.”

161.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, approached the Blessed One, and stood to one side.

Standing to one side, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, having looked over the Saṃgha of monks who were silent and still like a clear lake, exclaimed: “May my son, Prince Udayabhadda, be endowed with the same peace as this Saṃgha of monks is endowed with now.”

“Are your thoughts going to the one you love, Great King?”

“Beloved to me, venerable sir, is Prince Udayabhadda.

May my son, Prince Udayabhadda, be endowed with the same peace as this Saṃgha of monks is endowed with now.”

162.

Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the Vedehi queen, having bowed down to the Blessed One, having raised his hands in reverence to the Saṃgha of monks, sat down to one side. Having a mind free from ill-will, he dwells with compassion for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill-will and hatred.

Having abandoned sloth and torpor, he dwells free from sloth and torpor, perceiving light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor.

Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells unagitated, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse.

Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.

218.

"Just as, great king, a man might take a loan and apply it to his business.

And his business were to succeed.

So that he might pay off his old debts, and with what was left over, he could maintain a wife.

He might think: 'Before this, I developed my business by borrowing.

And my businesses succeeded.

So I paid off all the money of the old loan, and there is some extra left over to maintain a wife.'

And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy.

219.

"Just as, great king, a man might be sick, afflicted, gravely ill, so that he could not enjoy his food and his body would have no strength.

But after some time he would recover from that affliction and his food would agree with him and his body would regain strength.

He might think: 'Before this, I was sick, afflicted, gravely ill, and my food did not agree with me, and my body had no strength.

But now I have recovered from that affliction, and my food agrees with me, and my body has strength.'

And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy.

220.

"Just as, great king, a man might be imprisoned in a prison.

But after some time he would be released from that prison, safe and secure, with no loss to his property.

He might think: 'Before this, I was imprisoned in a prison, but now I am released from that prison, safe and secure.

And there is no loss to my property.’

And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy.

221.

"Just as, great king, a man might be a slave, not self-dependent but dependent on others, unable to go where he wants.

But after some time he would be released from slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a freed man able to go where he wants.

He might think: 'Before this, I was a slave, not self-dependent but dependent on others, unable to go where I wanted.

But now I am released from that slavery, self-dependent, independent of others, a freed man able to go where he wants.'

And as a result, he would become glad and experience joy.

222.

"Just as, great king, a man with wealth and property might travel along a desert road, where food is scarce and dangers abound.

But after some time he would cross that desert safely and arrive at a village, secure and free from danger.
He might think: “Before this I was wealthy and prosperous, but I embarked on a dangerous and frightening journey through a desolate wilderness in a time of famine.
Now, I have safely crossed that wilderness, reached the edge of a village, and am safe and free from danger."
Then, as a result of that, he would gain joy (*pāmojjaṃ*) and attain gladness (*somanassaṃ*).

223.
"In the same way, great king (*mahārāja*), when a *bhikkhu* sees that these five hindrances (*pañca nīvaraṇe*) are unabandoned within himself, he regards that as a debt (*iṇaṃ*), as a sickness (*rogaṃ*), as confinement in prison (*bandhanāgāraṃ*), as slavery (*dāsabyaṃ*), as a road across a desert (*kantāraddhānamaggaṃ*).
224.
"But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt (*āṇaṇyaṃ*), as good health (*ārogyaṃ*), as release from prison (*bandhanāmokkhaṃ*), as freedom from slavery (*bhujissaṃ*), as a safe place (*khemantabhūmiṃ*).
225.
"When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness (*pāmojjaṃ*) arises, from gladness arises rapture (*pīti*), when his mind is filled with rapture, his body (*kāyo*) becomes tranquil (*passambhati*); tranquil in body, he experiences happiness (*sukhaṃ vedeti*); being happy, his mind (*cittaṃ*) becomes concentrated (*samādhiyati*).
The first *jhāna* (*paṭhamajjhānaṃ*)

226.
"Quite secluded from sense-desires (*kāmehi*), secluded from unwholesome qualities (*akusalehi dhammehi*), he enters and remains in the first *jhāna* (*paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ*), which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought (*savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ*), with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion (*vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ*).
He He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses this body with delight and joy born of detachment ( *vivekajena pītisukhena* ), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this delight and joy born of detachment.
227.
"Just as a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice, kneading the soap-powder which he has sprinkled with water, forms from it, in a metal dish, a soft lump, so that the ball of soap-powder becomes one oleaginous mass, bound with oil so that nothing escapes — so this monk suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body with delight and joy born of detachment ( *vivekajena pītisukhena* ) so that no spot remains untouched.
This, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.
The Second Jhāna.
228.
“Further, great king, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, the *bhikkhu* enters and dwells in the second *jhāna*, which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied and sustained thought, and is filled with the rapture and happiness born of concentration (*samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ*).
He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of concentration (*samādhijena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.
229.
"Great king, suppose there were a deep lake whose waters welled up from below. It would have no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be refilled from time to time with showers of rain;
yet a current of cool water, welling up from within the lake, would drench, steep, saturate and suffuse the whole lake, so that there would be no part of that entire lake which is not suffused with the cool water.
In the same way, great king, the *bhikkhu* drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born of concentration (*samādhijena pītisukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness
This, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.
The Third Jhāna.
230.
“Further, great king, with the fading away of rapture, the *bhikkhu* dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body. Thus he enters and dwells in the third *jhāna*, of which the noble ones declare: ‘He dwells happily with equanimity and mindfulness.’
He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this happiness free from rapture (*nippītikena sukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.
231.
"Great king, suppose in a lotus pond there were blue, white, or red lotuses that have been born in the water, grow in the water, and never rise up above the water, but flourish immersed in the water. From their tips to their roots they would be drenched, steeped, saturated, and suffused with cool water, so that there would be no part of those lotuses not suffused with cool water. In the same way, great king, the *bhikkhu* drenches, steeps, saturates and suffuses his body with the happiness free from rapture (*nippītikena sukhena*), so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.
This, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.
The Fourth Jhāna.
232.
“Further, great king, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and grief, the *bhikkhu* enters and dwells in the fourth *jhāna*, which is neither pleasant nor painful and contains mindfulness fully purified by equanimity. He sits suffusing his body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his entire body not suffused by a pure bright mind. 233.
"Just as, great king, a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth, so that no part of his entire body would be untouched by the white cloth; even so, great king, a *bhikkhu* sits pervading this very body with a perfectly pure and bright mind, so that no part of his entire body is unpervaded by a perfectly pure and bright mind.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

Insight Knowledge (*vipassanāñāṇaṃ*)

234.
"Again, great king, the *bhikkhu*, with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and cleansed, spotless, free from defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and having attained imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.

He understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtiko), originating from father and mother, built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration; and this is my consciousness, which is dependent on it and bound up with it.’

235.
"Just as, great king, there were a *maṇi veḷuriya*, a beryl gem, beautiful, of good quality, with eight facets, well-cut, clear, limpid, without flaw, endowed with all excellent qualities.

And through it, there would run a thread (suttaṃ āvutaṃ), blue or yellow or red or white or brown.

A man with good sight, taking it in his hand, might review it thus: ‘This is a *maṇi veḷuriya*, a beryl gem, beautiful, of good quality, with eight facets, well-cut, clear, limpid, without flaw, endowed with all excellent qualities; and through it there runs this thread, blue or yellow or red or white or brown.’

Even so, great king, the *bhikkhu*, with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and cleansed, spotless, free from defilements, pliable, workable, steady, and having attained imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.

He understands thus: ‘This is my body, having material form, composed of the four great elements (cātumahābhūtiko), originating from father and mother, built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration; and this is my consciousness, which is dependent on it and bound up with it.’

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. Knowledge of the mind-made power.

236. "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, pliable, workable, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the creation of a mind-made body. He conjures up from this body another body, having form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, lacking no faculty.

237. "Just as, great king, a man might draw a reed from its sheath. He would think, 'This is the reed, this is the sheath; the reed is one thing, the sheath is another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or just as, great king, a man might draw a sword from its scabbard. He would think, ‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard; the sword is one thing, the scabbard is another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ Or just as, great king, a man might draw a snake from its slough. He would think, ‘This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake is one thing, the slough is another, but the snake has been drawn out from the slough.’ Just so, great king, when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, pliable, workable, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the creation of a mind-made body. He conjures up from this body another body, having form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, lacking no faculty. This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the life of a recluse, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

Knowledge of the power of magical abilities.

238. "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, free from defilements, pliable, workable, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and applies his mind to the various kinds of magical ability ( *iddhi-vidhā*). He experiences the various kinds of magical ability: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on the water without sinking as if it were earth. With the earth.
Sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird.
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful.
He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.

“Great king, suppose a skilled potter or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared clay whatever kind of vessel he might desire, that he could make and fashion it.
Or suppose a skilled ivory-worker or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared ivory whatever kind of ivory work he might desire, that he could make and fashion it.
Or suppose a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to make and fashion out of well-prepared gold whatever kind of gold work he might desire, that he could make and fashion it.
In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the *bhikkhu* directs and inclines it to the modes of supernormal power.
He experiences the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many, and having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unimpeded through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain as though through space.
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water.
He walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land.
Sitting cross-legged he travels through space like a winged bird.
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful.
He exercises mastery over the body as far as the Brahma-world.
This, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.
Knowledge of the divine ear.

"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*).
With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near. 241. “Just as, great king, a man is traveling along a highway.

He might hear the sound of a *bheri* drum, a *mudiṅga* drum, a conch shell, a *paṇava* drum, and a *dindima* drum.

It would occur to him, ‘That is the sound of a *bheri* drum,’ ‘That is the sound of a *mudiṅga* drum,’ ‘That is the sound of a conch shell, a *paṇava* drum, and a *dindima* drum.’

In the same way, great king, when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilements, malleable, ready to act, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*).

With the divine ear-element (*dibbāya sotadhātuyā*), which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those which are distant and those which are near.

This too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sāmaññaphalaṃ*), more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

Knowledge of others' minds (*cetopariyañāṇaṃ*).

242. "When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilements, malleable, ready to act, firm, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others (*cetopariyañāṇāya cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti*).

He knows the minds of other beings and other persons, having encompassed them with his own mind (*cetasā ceto paricca pajānāti*)—a mind with lust, he knows, ‘It is a mind with lust;’ a mind without lust, he knows, ‘It is a mind without lust;’ a mind with aversion, he knows, ‘It is a mind with aversion;’ a mind without aversion, he knows, ‘It is a mind without aversion;’ a mind with delusion, he knows, ‘It is a mind with delusion;’ a mind without delusion, he knows, ‘It is a mind without delusion;’ a constricted mind, he knows, ‘It is a constricted mind;’ a scattered mind, he knows, ‘It is a scattered mind;’ a superior mind, he knows, ‘It is a superior mind;’ an inferior mind, he knows, ‘It is an inferior mind;’ a surpassable mind, he knows, ‘It is a surpassable mind;’ an unsurpassed mind, he knows, ‘It is an unsurpassed mind;’ a concentrated mind, he knows, ‘It is a concentrated mind;’ an unconcentrated mind, he knows, ‘It is an unconcentrated mind;’ a liberated mind, he knows, ‘It is a liberated mind;’ an unliberated mind, he knows, ‘It is an unliberated mind.’" 243.
“Just as, great king, a woman or a man or a young person, fond of adornment, might examine his or her own face in a clear, pure, and bright mirror or in a bowl of water, and know, upon examination, if there were a spot, ‘There is a spot,’ or if there were no spot, ‘There is no spot’; in the same way, great king, when a *bhikkhu*'s mind is thus concentrated, purified, and cleansed, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, workable, steady, and has attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind towards the knowledge of encompassing the minds of others.

He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind: He understands a mind with lust (*sarāgaṃ citta*) as a mind with lust and a mind without lust (*vītarāgaṃ citta*) as a mind without lust; he understands a mind with hatred (*sadosaṃ citta*) as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred (*vītadosaṃ citta*) as a mind without hatred; he understands a mind with delusion (*samohaṃ citta*) as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion (*vītamohaṃ citta*) as a mind without delusion; he understands a contracted mind (*saṅkhittaṃ citta*) as a contracted mind and a distracted mind (*vikkhittaṃ citta*) as a distracted mind; he understands an exalted mind (*mahaggataṃ citta*) as an exalted mind and an unexalted mind (*amahaggataṃ citta*) as an unexalted mind; he understands a surpassable mind (*sauttaraṃ citta*) as a surpassable mind and an unsurpassed mind (*anuttaraṃ citta*) as an unsurpassed mind; he understands a concentrated mind (*samāhitaṃ citta*) as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind (*asamāhitaṃ citta*) as an unconcentrated mind; he understands a liberated mind (*vimuttaṃ citta*) as a liberated mind and an unliberated mind (*avimuttaṃ citta*) as an unliberated mind.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the life of a recluse, more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

Knowledge of the recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇaṃ*).

244.
And he, with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and cleansed, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, workable, steady, and having attained to imperturbability, directs and inclines his mind towards the knowledge of the recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇaṃ*).

He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth (*jātiṃ*), two births (*jātiyo*), three births (*jātiyo*), four births (*jātiyo*), five births (*jātiyo*), ten births (*jātiyo*), twenty births (*jātiyo*), thirty births (*jātiyo*), forty births (*jātiyo*), fifty births (*jātiyo*), a hundred births (*jātiṃ*), a thousand births (*jātiṃ*), a hundred thousand births (*jātiṃ*); many eons of world-contraction (*saṃvaṭṭakappe*), many eons of world-expansion (*vivaṭṭakappe*), many eons of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappe*): ‘There I was so named (*evaṃnāmo*).’ He was of such a clan, of such an appearance, such was his food, such his experience of pleasure and pain, such his life-term. Passing away from there, he arose in that place. There, too, I was so named, of such a clan, of such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away from there, he was reborn here.'

Thus, he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.

245.
"Great king, suppose a man were to go from his own village to another village, then from that village to still another village.

Then he might return from that village to his own village.

He might think to himself: 'I went from my own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to still another village. There too I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, spoke in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I returned to my own village.'

In the same way, great king, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, without blemish, rid of defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the *bhikkhu* directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the recollection of past lives (*pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇa*).

He recollects his numerous past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction (*saṃvaṭṭakappa*), many aeons of world-expansion (*vivaṭṭakappa*), many aeons of world-contraction and expansion (*saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappa*): ‘There I was so named (*evaṃnāmo*), of such a clan (*evaṃgotto*), with such an appearance (*evaṃvaṇṇo*), such was my food (*evamāhāro*), such my experience of pleasure and pain (*evaṃsukhadukkhappaṭisaṃvedī*), such my life-term (*evamāyupariyanto*). Passing away from there, I arose in that place. There, too, I was so named, of such a clan, of such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term. Passing away from there, he was reborn here.'

Thus, he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details.

This, too, great king, is a visible fruit of the ascetic life (*sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ*) more excellent and sublime than the previous ones. Knowledge of the divine eye.

246. When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.

With the purified divine eye ( *dibba-cakkhu* ) that surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their actions, thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—at the breaking-up of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell.

But these beings—who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, held right views, and undertook actions governed by right views—with the breakup of the body, after death, have reappeared in the good destination, in the heavenly world.’

Thus, with the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare according to their actions.

247. “Just as, great king, there might be a building at a crossroads,

and a man with good sight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house, walking along the street, or sitting in the middle of the square,

and he might think: ‘These people are entering a house, these are leaving, these are walking along the street, these are sitting in the middle of the square.’

Just so, great king, when a monk's mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and has attained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.

With the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate—and he understands how beings fare according to their actions, thus: ‘These beings—who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views, and undertook actions governed by wrong views—at the breaking-up of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, a lower realm, in hell. But these worthy beings were endowed with good conduct in body (kāyasucarita), speech (vacīsucarita), and mind (manosucarita), who did not revile the Noble Ones (ariyānaṃ anupavādakā), who held right view (sammādiṭṭhikā) and undertook actions under the influence of right view (sammādiṭṭhikammasamādānā).

At the breaking up of the body (kāyassa bhedā), after death (paraṃ maraṇā), they have been reborn in a happy destination (sugatiṃ), in the world of Heaven (saggaṃ lokaṃ upapannā’ti).

Thus, with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā), purified (visuddhena) and surpassing that of humans (atikkantamānusakena), he sees beings (satte) passing away (cavamāne) and re-arising (upapajjamāne), inferior (hīne) and superior (paṇīte), beautiful (suvaṇṇe) and ugly (dubbaṇṇe), fortunate (sugate) and unfortunate (duggate), and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions (yathākammūpage satte pajānāti).

This, O great king (mahārāja), is a visible fruit of the contemplative life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), more excellent (abhikkantatarañca) and sublime (paṇītatarañca) than the previous ones (purimehi sandiṭṭhikehi sāmaññaphalehi).

Knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (āsavakkhayañāṇaṃ).

248.

When his mind is thus concentrated (samāhite citte), purified (parisuddhe) and bright (pariyodāte), unblemished (anaṅgaṇe), free from defects (vigatūpakkilese), pliant (mudubhūte), malleable (kammaniye), steady (ṭhite), and attained to imperturbability (āneñjappatte), he directs (abhinīharati) and inclines (abhininnāmeti) it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ).

He knows as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): “This is suffering (idaṃ dukkha),” he knows as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): “This is the origin of suffering (ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo),” he knows as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): “This is the cessation of suffering (ayaṃ dukkhanirodho),” he knows as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering (ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā).”

He understands as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): ‘These are the cankers (ime āsavā).’ He understands as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): ‘This is the origin of the cankers (ayaṃ āsavasamudayo).’ He understands as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): ‘This is the cessation of the cankers (ayaṃ āsavanirodho).’ He understands as it really is (yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti): ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the cankers (ayaṃ āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā).’

Knowing and seeing thus (tassa evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato), his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire (kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati), from the canker of existence (bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati), and from the canker of ignorance (avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati). The knowledge arises in him: ‘It is liberated (vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami),’ and he understands (pajānāti): ‘Destroyed is birth (khīṇā jāti), the holy life has been lived (vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ), what had to be done has been done (kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ), there is nothing further beyond this (nāparaṃ itthattāyā).’

249.

"Just as if (seyyathāpi), O great king (mahārāja), there were a lake (udakarahado) in a mountain recess (pabbatasaṅkhepe), clear (accho), limpid (vippasanno), and undisturbed (anāvilo).

There, a man with good eyesight (cakkhumā puriso), standing on the bank (tīre ṭhito), could see oyster-shells (sippisambukampi), gravel (sakkharakathalampi), and shoals of fish (macchagumbampi), moving about (carantampi) and keeping still (tiṭṭhantampi).

He might think (tassa evamassa): ‘This pond (ayaṃ kho udakarahado) is clear (accho), limpid (vippasanno), and undisturbed (anāvilo).

And there within it (tatrime) are oyster-shells (sippisambukāpi), gravel (sakkharakathalāpi), and shoals of fish (macchagumbāpi), moving about (carantipi) and keeping still (tiṭṭhantipī).’

In the same way (evameva kho), O great king (mahārāja), when a monk’s (bhikkhu) mind is thus concentrated (evaṃ samāhite citte), purified (parisuddhe) and bright (pariyodāte), unblemished (anaṅgaṇe), free from defects (vigatūpakkilese), pliant (mudubhūte), malleable (kammaniye), steady (ṭhite), and attained to imperturbability (āneñjappatte), he directs (abhinīharati) and inclines (abhininnāmeti) it to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers (āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ).

‘He understands as it really is (so idaṃ dukkha’nti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti), ‘This is suffering,’ ‘He understands as it really is (ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ King Ajātasattu, son of the Videhi queen, of Magadha, having sat down to one side, said this to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain point, if the Blessed One would grant me an opportunity to answer my question."

"Ask whatever you wish to, great king (mahārāja)," he said.

163. "Just as there are these various crafts, venerable sir, such as elephant trainers (hatthārohā), horse trainers (assārohā), charioteers (rathikā), archers (dhanuggahā), standard bearers, camp marshals, providers of alms, high officials, royal princes, commandos, great warriors (mahānāgā), heroes, cuirassiers (cammayodhino), sons of slaves (dāsikaputtā), cooks (āḷārikā), barbers (kappakā), bath attendants (nhāpakā), cooks (sūdā), garland-makers (mālākārā), laundrymen (rajakā), weavers (pesakārā), basket-makers (naḷakārā), potters (kumbhakārā), accountants (gaṇakā), and stampers (muddikā), and whatever other various crafts there may be; these people enjoy the visible fruit of their craft in this very life. They please and gratify themselves by it, and they establish an uplifting donation, resulting in heavenly reward, conducive to heaven.

Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a fruit of the monastic life similarly visible in this very life (diṭṭheva dhamme sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ)?"

164. "Do you remember, great king (mahārāja), ever asking other ascetics and Brahmins this question?" "I do remember asking them, venerable sir (bhante), this question of other ascetics and Brahmins."

"If it is not too troublesome for you, great king (mahārāja), please tell how they answered."

"It is not troublesome for me, venerable sir (bhante), when the Blessed One is present, or one like the Blessed One."

"Then speak, great king (mahārāja)," he said.

The doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa

165. "Once, venerable sir (bhante), I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa; having approached Pūraṇa Kassapa, I exchanged friendly greetings with him. Having concluded the courteous and amiable talk, I sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, venerable sir (bhante), I said this to Pūraṇa Kassapa: 'Just as there are these various crafts, good Kassapa, such as elephant trainers (hatthārohā), horse trainers (assārohā), charioteers (rathikā)…" He understands as it actually is: “This is the cessation of suffering ( *dukkhanirodho*)’; he understands as it actually is: “This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering (*dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*)’

And he knows as it really is: “These are the corruptions (*āsavā*)”, “This is the origin of the corruptions (*āsavasamudayo*)”, “This is the cessation of the corruptions (*āsavanirodho*)”, “This is the path leading to the cessation of the corruptions (*āsavanirodhagāminī paṭipadā*)".

And through his knowing and seeing thus, his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense-desire (*kāmāsava*), from the corruption of becoming (*bhavāsava*), from the corruption of ignorance (*avijjāsava*), and the knowledge arises in him: “This is deliverance!”, and he knows: “Birth (*jāti*) is finished, the holy life (*brahmacariya*) has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here."

This, great king (*mahārāja*), is a visible fruit (*sāmaññaphala*) of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones.

And, great king (*mahārāja*), there is no other fruit of recluseship (*sāmaññaphala*) higher or more sublime than this one."

Account of Ajātasattu's Acceptance as a Lay Follower (*ajātasattuupāsakattapaṭivedanā*).

250.

When this was said, King Ajātasattu, son of the Videhi queen, said to the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*): “Excellent, venerable sir (*bhante*)! Excellent, venerable sir (*bhante*)!

Just as, Lord (*bhante*), one should set upright what has been upset or should uncover what is covered or should point out the way to one who is astray or should bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms, even so is Dhamma explained in many a figure by the Lord (*bhagavatā*).

I go to the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*) for refuge (*saraṇaṃ*), and to the Dhamma (*dhammañca*), and to the Saṅgha (*bhikkhusaṅghañca*) of monks.

May the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower (*upāsakaṃ*) who has taken refuge for as long as life shall last!

Venerable sir (*bhante*), a transgression overcame me. I was so foolish, so deluded, so unskillful that for the sake of sovereignty I deprived my father, a righteous man and a righteous king, of his life.

May the Lord (*bhagavā*) accept my confession of my evil deed that I may restrain myself in future!’

251.

“Indeed, Sire (*mahārāja*), transgression overcame you when you deprived your father, that good man and just king, of his life.

But since you have seen your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it according to the Dhamma (*yathādhammaṃ*), we acknowledge it.

For, great king (*mahārāja*), this is growth in the discipline of the Noble One (*ariyassa vinaye*): that a person sees his transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it according to the Dhamma (*yathādhammaṃ*), and achieves restraint (*saṃvaraṃ*) in the future.” archers (dhanuggahā), standard bearers (celakā), camp marshals (calakā), army caterers (piṇḍadāyakā), champions (uggā), high royal officers (rājaputtā), front-line soldiers (pakkhandino), bull-warriors (mahānāgā), military heroes (sūrā), mail-clad warriors (cammayodhino), domestic slaves’ sons (dāsikaputtā), confectioners (āḷārikā), barbers (kappakā), bath attendants (nhāpakā), cooks (sūdā), garland-makers (mālākārā), laundrymen (rajakā), weavers (pesakārā), basket-makers (naḷakārā), potters (kumbhakārā), statisticians (gaṇakā), accountants (muddikā), and whatever other skills there are— they live here and now from the visible fruit of their skill (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sippaphalaṃ upajīvanti), they delight and gratify themselves, delight and gratify their mother and father, delight and gratify their children and wives, delight and gratify their friends and companions, and establish an uplifting offering to ascetics and Brahmins, conducive to heaven, resulting in happiness, and leading to heaven.

“Could you, Venerable Kassapa, point to such a reward visible here and now, as a fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ paññapetu’nti)?”

166. “When this was said, venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa said this to me: ‘Great king, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief or causes to grieve, by one who causes weariness or causes to be wearied, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies—no evil (pāpaṃ) is done.

If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass of flesh (maṃsakhalaṃ), one single heap of flesh (maṃsapuñjaṃ), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing (hananto), slaying (ghātento), cutting (chindanto) or causing to be cut (chedāpento), burning (pacanto) or causing to be burnt (pācāpento), there would be no evil (pāpaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of evil (pāpassa āgamo).

Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving (dadanto) and causing to be given (dāpento), sacrificing (yajanto) and causing to be sacrificed (yajāpento), there would be no merit (puññaṃ) as a result of that, no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo).

In giving (dānena), self-control (damena), restraint (saṃyamena) and truthful speech (saccavajjena) there is no merit (puññaṃ), and no origin of merit (puññassa āgamo)’.

Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

“Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango (ambaṃ) would speak about a breadfruit (labujaṃ), or as if one asked about a breadfruit (labujaṃ) would speak about a mango (ambaṃ), in the same way when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about a visible fruit of the ascetic life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained to me the inefficacy of action (akiriyaṃ byākāsi).

Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse (samaṇaṃ) or Brahmin (brāhmaṇaṃ) living in his realm (vijite vasantaṃ)’.

So I, venerable sir, neither rejoiced in the statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa (pūraṇassa kassapassa bhāsitaṃ) nor did I reject it (neva abhinandiṃ nappaṭikkosiṃ).

Without having rejoiced Without rejecting it, feeling displeased, not uttering a word of dissatisfaction, but accepting his doctrine without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

The doctrine of Makkhali Gosala.

167.

"Once, venerable sir, I approached Makkhali Gosāla, and after approaching, I exchanged greetings with Makkhali Gosāla.

Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, I sat down to one side.

Sitting to one side, I said to Makkhali Gosāla: 'Just as these various arts and crafts…pe… is it possible, friend Gosāla, to describe a fruit of the ascetic life visible in this very life?'

168.

"When this was said, venerable sir, Makkhali Gosāla said to me: 'There is no cause, great king, no condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without a cause or condition.

There is no cause, no condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without a cause or condition.

There is no self-determination, no determination by others, no human determination. There is no strength, no energy, no human power, no human might.

All beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are without power, without strength, without energy; subject to the changes of destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.

There are fourteen hundred thousand principal modes of origin and sixty and six hundred more. There are five hundred kinds of action, five kinds of action, three kinds of action, full action and half-action; sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate aeons, six classes, eight stages of human progress, forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood, forty-nine hundred kinds of wanderers, forty-nine hundred abodes of *nāgas*, two thousand faculties, thirty hundred hells, thirty-six realms of elements, seven conscious embryos, seven unconscious embryos, seven *nigaṇṭha* embryos, seven gods, seven humans, seven *piśācas*, seven lakes, seven whirlpools, seven hundred whirlpools, seven precipices, seven hundred precipices, seven dreams, seven hundred dreams, eighty-four great *kappas*, hundreds of thousands, which both fools and wise, wandering through transmigration, will make an end to suffering.

There. There is no such thing as: "Through this virtuous conduct ( *śīla*), or observance ( *vata*), or austerity ( *tapas*), or holy life ( *brahmacarya*), I will ripen action ( *karma*) that is not yet ripe, or I will gradually eliminate action (*karma*) that is already ripe."
Pleasure and pain are meted out in this round of rebirths ( *saṃsāra*) which has fixed limits; there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it.
Just as a ball of string, when thrown, unrolls until it comes to its end, so too, by running and wandering through the round of rebirths (*saṃsāra*), both fools and the wise will make an end to suffering (*duḥkhassāntaṃ*).
169.
"Thus, venerable sir (*bhante*), when asked about a visible fruit of recluseship, Makkhali Gosāla explained to me purification through wandering in *saṃsāra*.
Venerable sir (*bhante*), just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me purification through wandering in *saṃsāra*.
Then, venerable sir (*bhante*), I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a recluse ( *samaṇa*) or brahmin ( *brāhmaṇa*) living in his realm.’
So, venerable sir (*bhante*), I neither applauded nor rejected Makkhali Gosala’s words ( *bhāsitaṃ*).
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, being displeased and not uttering words of displeasure, but still considering what he had said without overturning it, I got up from my seat and left.
The doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala.
170.
"Another time, venerable sir (*bhante*), I approached Ajita Kesakambala, and after approaching, I exchanged greetings with Ajita Kesakambala.
Having exchanged courteous and amiable talk, I sat down to one side.
Having sat down to one side, venerable sir (*bhante*), I said this to Ajita Kesakambala: ‘Just as these various skilled trades…pe… is it possible, venerable Ajita, to point out in the same way a visible fruit of recluseship ( *sāmaññaphalaṃ*) in this very life ( *diṭṭheva dhamme*)?’
171.
"When this was said, venerable sir (*bhante*), Ajita Kesakambala said this to me: ‘There is no giving ( *dinnaṃ*), great king ( *mahārāja*), there is no sacrifice (*yiṭṭhaṃ*), there is no offering ( *hutaṃ*), there is no fruit or result ( *phalaṃ vipāko*) of good and bad actions (*sukatadukkaṭānaṃ kammānaṃ*), there is no this world, there is no other world, there is no mother ( *mātā*), there is no father ( *pitā*), there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously (*sattā opapātikā*), there are no recluses ( *samaṇabrāhmaṇā*) and brahmins in the world who have attained right practice ( *sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā*), who proclaim this world and the other world He declared, after gaining deep knowledge for himself.
This human being is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space.
Four men carry the corpse along on a bier.
their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground.
There the bones whiten, the sacrifice ends in ashes.
The practice of giving is a doctrine of fools.
the talk of those who preach a doctrine of survival is vain and false.
Fools and wise, at the breaking-up of the body, are destroyed and perish, they do not exist after death.”
172.
“Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me annihilation (ucchedaṃ byākāsi).
Venerable sir, just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about a visible fruit of recluseship, he explained to me annihilation (ucchedaṃ byākāsi).
Then, venerable sir, I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a *śramaṇa* or *brāhmaṇa* living in his realm.’
So I neither rejoiced in the statement of Ajita Kesakambala nor did I reject it.
Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.
The doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana
173.
’Once I visited Pakudha Kaccayana, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side.
Having ex-changed courtesies, I sat down to one side.
I then asked him if he could point out any fruit of recluseship visible here and now.
174.
“When I had finished speaking, Pakudha Kaccáyana said to me: ‘Great king, there are seven bodies that are unmade, unfashioned, uncreated, without a creator, barren, immovable as a pillar.
They do not shake, they do not change, they do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain.

Which are the seven? The earth-body ( *prthivīkāya*), the water-body (*āpakāya*), the fire-body (*tejokāya*), the air-body (*vāyokāya*), pleasure (*sukha*), pain (*duḥkha*), and the soul (*jīva*) as the seventh – these seven bodies are unmade, not made by anything, uncreated, not created, barren, immovable as a pillar.

They do not shake, they do not change, they do not obstruct one another; they are incapable of causing one another either pleasure or pain, or both pleasure and pain.

Herein, there is no killer, no slayer, no hearer, no proclaimer, neither knower nor causer of knowing.

Even he who cuts off a head with a sharp sword, he does not deprive anyone of life; the sword merely passes through the space between the seven bodies.

175.
"Thus, venerable sir (*bhante*), when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship (*sāmaññaphala*), he answered me with something completely irrelevant.

Venerable sir (*bhante*), just as if one asked about a mango would speak about a breadfruit, or as if one asked about a breadfruit would speak about a mango, in the same way, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about a visible fruit of recluseship (*sāmaññaphala*), he answered me with something completely irrelevant.

Then, venerable sir (*bhante*), I thought to myself: ‘One like myself should not think of troubling a *śramaṇa* or *brāhmaṇa* living in his realm.’

So I, venerable sir (*bhante*), neither rejoiced in the statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana nor did I reject it. But though I neither rejoiced in it nor rejected it, I still felt dissatisfied, yet did not utter a word of dissatisfaction. Without accepting his doctrine, without embracing it, I got up from my seat and left.

The doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta

176.
"Once, venerable sir (*bhante*), I approached Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta; having approached, I exchanged greetings with Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.

Having exchanged courteous talk which invites trust and recollection, I sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, venerable sir (*bhante*), I said this to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta: ‘Just as these various crafts…pe… is it possible, venerable Aggivessana, in the same way to describe here and now the visible fruit of recluseship (*sāmaññaphala*)? ’ 177.
"When this had been said, venerable sir, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta said this to me: 'Here, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with a fourfold restraint (cātuyāmasaṃvarasaṃvuto hoti).

"And how, great king, is a Nigaṇṭha restrained with a fourfold restraint? Here, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with regard to all water (sabbavārivārito ca hoti), he is endowed with the avoidance of all evil (sabbavāriyutto ca), he is cleansed by the avoidance of all evil (sabbavāridhuto ca), and he is suffused with the avoidance of all evil (sabbavāriphuṭo ca).

"In this way, great king, a Nigaṇṭha is restrained with a fourfold restraint.

"Great king, when a Nigaṇṭha is thus restrained with this fourfold restraint, this Nigaṇṭha [Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta (syā.
ka.)] is called self-perfected (gatatto ca), self-controlled (yatatto ca), and self-established (ṭhitatto ca).’

178.
"Thus, venerable sir, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruit of the ascetic life visible in this very life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ), he explained the fourfold restraint (cātuyāmasaṃvaraṃ).

"Venerable sir, just as if on being asked about a mango (ambaṃ) one would speak about a breadfruit (labujaṃ), or as if on being asked about a breadfruit one would speak about a mango, just so, venerable sir, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruit of the ascetic life visible in this very life, he explained the fourfold restraint.

"Then, venerable sir, this occurred to me: ‘How indeed could one like me think of troubling an ascetic (samaṇaṃ) or a Brahmin (brāhmaṇaṃ) living in my realm (vijite vasantaṃ apasādetabbaṃ maññeyyā’ti).’

"So I, venerable sir, neither rejoiced in the statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, nor did I reject it.

Without rejoicing, without rejecting, feeling no delight, without expressing words of delight, without accepting that statement, without spurning it, I got up from my seat and departed.

The doctrine of Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta

179.
"On one occasion, venerable sir, I approached Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and after approaching, I exchanged greetings with Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta.

Having concluded the conversation of greetings and courtesies, I sat down to one side.

Having sat down to one side, venerable sir, I said this to Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta: ‘Just as these various crafts (puthusippāyatanāni)…pe… is it possible, venerable Sañcaya, to describe the fruit of the ascetic life visible in this very life (sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmaññaphalaṃ paññapetu’nti)?’

180.
"When this was said, venerable sir, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta said this to me: ‘If you ask me, "Is there another world (atthi paro loko)?" if I thought that there is another world, I would declare to you that "There is another world."

It is not like this for me, it is not like that for me, it is not otherwise for me, it is not "no" for me, it is not 13. The Discourse on the Three Vedas ( *tevijjasuttaṃ*)

518. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in Kosala with a large Saṅgha of monks, about five hundred in all. He arrived at a Kosalan Brahmin village named Manasākaṭa.

There, the Blessed One stayed in Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove (*ambavana*) on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

519. Now at that time, many well-known and wealthy Brahmins were living in Manasākaṭa, namely the Brahmin Caṅkī, the Brahmin Tārukkha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the Brahmin Todeyya, and other well-known and wealthy Brahmins.

520. Then, while the youths Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were strolling for exercise, a discussion arose between them about the right path and the wrong path ( *maggāmagge kathā udapādi*).

Then the youth Vāseṭṭha said: "This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path to salvation, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti!"

Bhāradvāja also said: "This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha!"

Vāseṭṭha was unable to convince Bhāradvāja, nor was Bhāradvāja able to convince Vāseṭṭha.

521. Then the youth Vāseṭṭha addressed the youth Bhāradvāja: "This ascetic Gotama, the son of the Śākyas, who went forth from the Śākya clan, is staying in Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove (*ambavana*) on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.

Now a good reputation has spread concerning the esteemed Gotama: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is an *arahant*, a perfectly enlightened one (*sammāsambuddho*), perfect in knowledge and conduct (*vijjācaraṇasampanno*), a *sugata*, a knower of the world (*lokavidū*), unsurpassed, a trainer of those who can be trained (*purisadammasārathi*), a teacher of gods and humans (*satthā devamanussānaṃ*), a Buddha (*buddho*), a Blessed One (*bhagavā*).'

Come, Bhāradvāja, let us go to the ascetic Gotama. Having gone to him, let us ask the ascetic Gotama about this matter.

As the ascetic Gotama explains to us, so we will remember it."

"So be it, sir," the youth Bhāradvāja replied to the youth Vāseṭṭha.

The Talk About the Path and Not the Path (*maggāmagga kathā*)

522. Then the youths Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja went to the Blessed One. Having gone to him, they exchanged greetings with the Blessed One.

Having exchanged friendly and courteous greetings, they sat down to one side.

Seated to one side, the youth Vāseṭṭha said to the Blessed One: "Here, venerable Gotama, while we were strolling for exercise, a discussion arose between us about the right path and the wrong path.

I say this: 'This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path to salvation, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti.'

The youth Bhāradvāja says this: 'This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path to salvation, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.'

Concerning this, venerable Gotama, there is disagreement, there is dispute, there is diversity of views."

523. "So, Vāseṭṭha, you say this: 'This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path to salvation, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti.'

Bhāradvāja says this: 'This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path to salvation, which leads to union with Brahmā, as taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.'

Now, Vāseṭṭha, what is the disagreement about? What is the dispute about? What is the diversity of views about?"

524. "About the path and not-path, Gotama.

Although, venerable Gotama, the Brahmins teach different paths—the Adhhariya Brahmins, the Tittiriya Brahmins, the Chandoka Brahmins, the Bavhārijjha Brahmins—still, all those paths lead to salvation, they lead to union with Brahmā." "Just as if, Reverend Gotama, near a village or town there are many different paths, do all these converge on that village? Even so, Reverend Gotama, though the *brāhmaṇas* propound various paths—the *Addhariya brāhmaṇas*, the *Tittiriya brāhmaṇas*, the *Chandoka brāhmaṇas*, the *Bavhārijjhā brāhmaṇas*—do all these ways lead to union with Brahmā for the one who follows them?"

The discourse with Vāseṭṭha

525.

“Do you say, Vāseṭṭha, that they lead?” “Yes, Reverend Gotama, I say that they lead.”
“Do you say, Vāseṭṭha, that they lead?” “Yes, Reverend Gotama, I say that they lead.”
“Do you say, Vāseṭṭha, that they lead?” “Yes, Reverend Gotama, I say that they lead.”
“But, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single *brāhmaṇa* among these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face to face?” “No, Reverend Gotama, there is not.”
“But, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single teacher of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face to face?” “No, Reverend Gotama, there is not.”
“But, Vāseṭṭha, is there even the teacher's teacher of any one of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face to face?” “No, Reverend Gotama, there is not.”
“But, Vāseṭṭha, is there any one of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas back to the seventh generation of teachers who has seen Brahmā face to face?” “No, Reverend Gotama, there is not.”

526.

“But, Vāseṭṭha, what of those former sages of the *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the *mantras*, the expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient *mantra* verses, chanted, pronounced, and collected, are nowadays sung and spoken about by these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas—such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—did even they say thus: ‘We know this, we see this: Brahmā is there, Brahmā is like this, Brahmā is here’?” “No, Reverend Gotama, there is not.”

527.

“So, Vāseṭṭha, not one of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face.
Nor has one of their teachers.
Nor even the teacher’s teacher.
Nor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers.
And those former sages of the *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the *mantras*, the expounders of the *mantras*, whose ancient *mantra* verses, chanted, pronounced, and collected, are nowadays sung and spoken about by these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas—such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—not even they said thus: ‘We know this, we see this: Brahmā is there, Brahmā is like this, Brahmā is here.’
Yet these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas say thus: ‘We teach the path to union with that which we do not know, that which we do not see.
This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahmā!’”

528.

“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas declare turn out to be ill-founded?” “Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas declare does turn out to be ill-founded.”
“That is right, Vāseṭṭha. When these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas teach a path to union with that which they do not know and do not see, saying, ‘This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahmā,’ this cannot possibly be right.

529.

“Just as, Vāseṭṭha, a file of blind men go on, clinging to each other, and the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, and the last one sees nothing—
even so, Vāseṭṭha, it seems to me that the talk of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas is like a file of blind men: the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, the last one sees nothing.
The talk of these *brāhmaṇas* learned in the Three Vedas turns out to be just a joke, mere words, empty and vain. 530.
‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon, just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set, do they pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands, and circumambulate them?’
‘Yes, Reverend Gotama, the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon, just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set, they pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands, and circumambulate them.’

531.
‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? These Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who see the sun and moon just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set, pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands, and circumambulate them – can these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas point out the path to union (*sahabyatā*) with the sun and moon, saying: “This alone is the straight path (*ujumagga*), this the direct way (*añjasāyana*), the means of escape (*niyyānika*), which leads the doer to union with the sun and moon”?’
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘So, Vāseṭṭha, these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who see the sun and moon just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set, pray, sing praises, worship with clasped hands and circumambulate them, even they cannot point out the path to union with the sun and moon, saying: “This alone is the straight path, this the direct way, the means of escape, which leads the doer to union with the sun and moon.”

532.
‘Thus, it seems that the Brahmins versed in the Three Vedas do not see Brahmā face to face (*sakkhidiṭṭha*).
Nor have the teachers (*ācariya*) of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face.
Nor have the teachers of teachers (*ācariyapācariya*) of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face.
Nor have the most ancient teachers (*ācariyāmahayuga*) even seven generations back of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face.
Those ancient sages (*isayo*) of the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the *mantras* (*mantānaṃ kattāro*), the expounders of the *mantras* (*mantānaṃ pavattāro*), whose ancient collection of *mantra* verses (*mantapadaṃ*) is now chanted, spoken, and compiled by the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, and they sing after, speak about, repeat what was spoken, and recite what was recited – such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu, even they did not say, "We know this, we see this, where Brahmā is, by whom Brahmā is, or in whom Brahmā is."

Indeed, the **tevijja** *brāhmaṇas* say thus: "We teach the path to union with that which we neither know nor see. This alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape for one who practices it for union with Brahmā."

533.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* declare turn out to be ill-founded?" "Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* declare turns out to be ill-founded."

"That is right, Vāseṭṭha. When these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* teach a path that they do not know and see, saying, "This alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape for one who practices it for union with Brahmā," this cannot possibly be right.

The simile of the beautiful woman of the country.

534.

"Vāseṭṭha, it is just as if a man were to say: "I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country."

They might say to him: "Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love - do you know whether she is from the *khattiya* (warrior) class or the *brāhmaṇa* (priestly) class or the *vessa* (merchant) class or the *sudda* (laborer) class?" If so questioned, he would say, "No."

"They might then say to him, 'Good man, this most beautiful girl in this country you seek and love, do you know her name and clan, whether she is tall or short or of medium height, whether she is dark or fair or golden-skinned, or from what village, town, or city she comes?" If so questioned, he would say, "No."

They might say to him: "Well then, you don’t know or see the one you seek for and desire?" If so questioned, he would answer, "Yes".

535.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, when this is the case, does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid?" "Certainly, Reverend Gotama, when this is the case, the talk of that man turns out to be stupid."

536.

"Even so, Vāseṭṭha, not one of these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* has seen Brahmā face to face, nor has one of their teachers seen Brahmā face to face, nor has one of the teachers of their teachers seen Brahmā face to face.

Nor has even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers seen Brahmā face to face.

And those ancient sages of the *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas*, the makers of the hymns, the composers of the hymns, to whom the present *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* adhere, following after them and repeating their utterances—chanting, reciting, and repeating what was spoken, such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—even they did not say, "We know this, we see this, where Brahmā is, by whom Brahmā is, or in whom Brahmā is."

Indeed, the *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* say thus: "We teach the path to union with that which we neither know nor see. This alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape for one who practices it for union with Brahmā."

537.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Such being the case, does not what these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* declare turn out to be ill-founded?" "Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama, such being the case, what these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* declare turns out to be ill-founded."

"That is right, Vāseṭṭha. When these *tevijja* *brāhmaṇas* teach a path that they do not know and see, saying, "This alone is the straight path, this is the direct way, the means of escape for one who practices it for union with Brahmā," this cannot possibly be right.

The simile of the staircase.

538.

"It is just as if, Vāseṭṭha, a man were to build a staircase at a crossroads for ascending to a palace.

They might say to him: 'Good man, this staircase you are building to ascend to the palace, do you know the palace, whether it is to the east or to the south or to the south? "Or whether it faces the west, or whether it faces the north, or whether it is high, low or medium in height?" If asked thus, he would answer "No."

"Then they would say to him: 'Hey fellow, you do not know, you do not see, and yet you are building a staircase for that palace?'" If asked thus, he would answer "Yes."

539.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, when this is the case, does not the talk of that man turn out to be unconvincing?" "Certainly, Reverend Gotama, when this is the case, the talk of that man turns out to be unconvincing."

540.

"Even so, Vāseṭṭha, not one of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face; nor has any teacher of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face; nor has any teacher of teachers of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face; nor has any in the line of teachers back to the seventh generation of teachers of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas seen Brahmā face to face.

Even the former seers of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas, the authors of the hymns, the founders of the hymns, whose ancient verses that are chanted, recited and collected by present day *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas, and who are followed, repeated, spoken and recited after – such as Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamātaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu – even they did not say: 'We know this, we see this, where Brahmā is, how Brahmā is, or where Brahmā is.'

Yet these *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas say: "What we do not know, what we do not see, we teach the path to union with that. This is the straight path, this is the direct way, which leads to union with Brahmā for those who practice it."

541.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, when this is the case, does not the talk of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas turn out to be unconvincing?" "Certainly, Reverend Gotama, when this is the case, the talk of the *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas turns out to be unconvincing."

"Good, Vāseṭṭha.

Indeed, Vāseṭṭha, these *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas, without knowing and without seeing, will teach the path to union with that.

This is the straight path, this is the direct way, which leads to union with Brahmā for those who practice it' – such a thing cannot be.

The simile of the Aciravatī River.

542.

"It is as if, Vāseṭṭha, this Aciravatī River were full of water, brimful and able to be drunk by a crow.

Then a man should come along, wanting to cross to the other side, seeking the far shore, going to the far shore, wishing to cross over.

Standing on this bank, he should call to the far bank: 'Come here, far bank, come here!'

543.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, would the far bank of the Aciravatī River come over to this bank because of that man’s calling, beseeching, wishing or praising?" "No, Reverend Gotama."

544.

"Even so, Vāseṭṭha, those *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas, neglecting those qualities that make one a *brāhmaṇa*, and adopting those qualities that do not make one a *brāhmaṇa*, say thus: 'We call upon Indra, we call upon Soma, we call upon Varuṇa, we call upon Īsāna, we call upon Prajāpati, we call upon Brahmā, we call upon Mahiddhi, we call upon Yama.'

But that these *brāhmaṇa*s versed in the three Vedas, neglecting those qualities that make one a *brāhmaṇa* and adopting those qualities that do not make one a *brāhmaṇa*, due to calling, beseeching, wishing or praising, will, upon the dissolution of the body, after death, attain union with Brahmā – such a thing cannot be.

545.

"It is as if, Vāseṭṭha, this Aciravatī River were full of water, brimful and able to be drunk by a crow.

Then a man should come along, wanting to cross to the other side, seeking the far shore, going to the far shore, wishing to cross over.

But he was bound on this bank with a strong chain, his hands behind his back, in a tight knot.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, would that man be able to cross from this bank of the Aciravatī River to the far bank?" "No, Reverend Gotama." 546.

‘In just the same way, Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline these five objects of desire (*kāmaguṇā*) are called bonds and fetters.

Which five? Forms cognizable by the eye (*cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā*) that are wished for (*iṭṭhā*), desired (*kantā*), agreeable (*manāpā*), and likeable (*piyarūpā*), connected with sensual desire (*kāmūpasaṃhitā*) and provocative of lust (*rajanīyā*).

Sounds cognizable by the ear… Odours cognizable by the nose… Flavours cognizable by the tongue… Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for (*iṭṭhā*), desired (*kantā*), agreeable (*manāpā*), and likeable (*piyarūpā*), connected with sensual desire (*kāmūpasaṃhitā*) and provocative of lust (*rajanīyā*).

These five objects of desire (*kāmaguṇā*) in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fetters.

And those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved, infatuated by these five objects of desire (*kāmaguṇā*), which they enjoy guiltily, unaware of danger, knowing no way out.

‘But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do, and instead adopt what a non-Brahmin would do, who are enslaved by these five objects of desire (*kāmaguṇā*)… knowing no way out, should attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā—that is just not possible.

547.

‘It is just as if this River Aciravatī were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it,

and a man should come along wishing to cross over, to get to the other side, to get across,

and were to lie down on this bank, covering his head with a shawl.

What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Would that man be able to get to the other side?” “No, Master Gotama.”

548.

‘In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances (*nīvaraṇā*) are called obstacles (*āvaraṇā*), hindrances (*nīvaraṇā*), coverings-up (*onāhanā*), envelopings (*pariyonāhanā*).

Which five? The hindrance of sensual desire (*kāmacchandanīvaraṇaṃ*), the hindrance of ill will (*byāpādanīvaraṇaṃ*), the hindrance of sloth and torpor (*thinamiddhanīvaraṇaṃ*), the hindrance of restlessness and remorse (*uddhaccakukkuccanīvaraṇaṃ*), and the hindrance of doubt (*vicikicchānīvaraṇaṃ*).

These five hindrances (*nīvaraṇā*) in the Ariyan discipline are called obstacles (*āvaraṇā*), hindrances (*nīvaraṇā*), coverings-up (*onāhanā*), envelopings (*pariyonāhanā*).

549.

And these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up, hemmed in, obstructed, entangled in these five hindrances (*nīvaraṇā*).

Those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas Those practices which make one a *brāhmin*, having abandoned those practices, and behaving according to those practices which do not make one a *brāhmin*, being covered, enveloped, bound, and completely bound by the five hindrances, will, at the breaking up of the body after death, attain union with Brahma—such a thing is not possible.
A discussion regarding association.

550.
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? What have you heard said by *brāhmins* who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Is Brahmā encumbered or unencumbered?” “Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama.”
“Is he full of hate or without hate?” “Without hate, Reverend Gotama.”
“Is he full of ill-will or without ill-will?” “Without ill-will, Reverend Gotama.”
“Is he impure or pure?” “Pure, Reverend Gotama.”
“Is he disciplined or undisciplined?” “Disciplined, Reverend Gotama.”
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Are the *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas encumbered or unencumbered?” “Encumbered, Reverend Gotama.”
“Are they full of hate or without hate?” “Full of hate, Reverend Gotama.”
“Are they full of ill-will or without ill-will?” “Full of ill-will, Reverend Gotama.”
“Are they impure or pure?” “Impure, Reverend Gotama.”
“Are they disciplined or undisciplined?” “Undisciplined, Reverend Gotama.”

551.
“So, Vāseṭṭha, the *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered, and Brahmā is unencumbered.
Is there any communion, anything in common between these encumbered *brāhmins* and the unencumbered Brahmā?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”
“That is good, Vāseṭṭha. That these encumbered *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas should, at the breaking up of the body after death, attain union with the unencumbered Brahmā—such a thing is not possible.
Likewise, Vāseṭṭha, the *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas are full of hate, but Brahmā is without hate… full of ill-will, but Brahmā is without ill-will… impure, but Brahmā is pure… undisciplined,
but the *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas are disciplined, but Brahmā is disciplined. Do these undisciplined *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas have any communion, anything in common with the disciplined Brahmā?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”
“That is good, Vāseṭṭha. That these undisciplined *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas should, at the breaking up of the body after death, attain union with the disciplined Brahmā—such a thing is not possible.

552.
“Here, Vāseṭṭha, the *brāhmins* learned in the Three Vedas, having sat down, sink down, and sinking down, they attain to confusion, and I think they cross over the driest ground.
Therefore, this threefold knowledge of the *brāhmins* is called the threefold desert, the threefold wilderness, the threefold destruction.”

553.
When this was said, the young man Vāseṭṭha said this to the Blessed One: “I have heard it said, Reverend Gotama, that the ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with Brahmā.”
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?
Is Manasākaṭa near from here, or is Manasākaṭa far from here?” “Yes, Reverend Gotama, Manasākaṭa is near from here, Manasākaṭa is not far from here.”

554.
“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasākaṭa.
If someone who had lost the road to Manasākaṭa were to ask him about the path to Manasākaṭa,
would there be any slowness or bewilderment in that man born and brought up in Manasākaṭa, when asked about the path to Manasākaṭa?” “No, Reverend Gotama.”
“What is the reason for that?” “Because, Reverend Gotama, that man is born and brought up in Manasākaṭa, all the paths to Manasākaṭa are well known to him.”
“It might be, Vāseṭṭha, that there would be some slowness or bewilderment in that man born and brought up in Manasākaṭa, when asked about the path to Manasākaṭa, but there would be no slowness or bewilderment in the Tathāgata when asked about the Brahma-world or the path leading to the Brahmā-world.
"For, Vāseṭṭha, I know Brahmā and the world of Brahmā (brahmaloka), and the path of practice (pratipad) leading to the world of Brahmā, and how one who has practiced attains to the world of Brahmā, that too I know." 555.

When this was said, the student Vāseṭṭha said this to the Blessed One: "I have heard it said, Reverend Gotama, that the ascetic Gotama teaches the way to companionship with Brahmā."

"It would be good if the esteemed Gotama were to teach the way to companionship with Brahmā. May the esteemed Gotama uplift the people of Brahmā!"

"Then listen, Vāseṭṭha, pay close attention, I will speak."

"Yes, sir," replied the student Vāseṭṭha to the Blessed One.

The Teaching of the Path to the Realm of Brahmā

556.

The Blessed One said this: "Here, Vāseṭṭha, a *Tathāgata* arises in the world, an *Arhant*, a Fully Enlightened Buddha…pe… (as in sections 190-212, so it should be expanded).

This is how, Vāseṭṭha, a *bhikkhu* is accomplished in virtue…pe… When he sees these five hindrances abandoned in himself, joy arises. Gladdened, rapture arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he experiences happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.

"He dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with loving-kindness.

Likewise the second direction.

Likewise the third direction.

Likewise the fourth direction.

Thus above, below, across, everywhere, completely, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill-will.

"Just as, Vāseṭṭha, a strong trumpeter might easily make himself heard in the four directions, so too, Vāseṭṭha, by this cultivation of loving-kindness, that liberation of the heart whereby any action that is of limited extent no longer remains, no longer persists there.

This too, Vāseṭṭha, is the path to companionship with Brahmā.

"Furthermore, Vāseṭṭha, a *bhikkhu* dwells pervading one direction with a mind imbued with compassion…pe… with a mind imbued with sympathetic joy…pe… with a mind imbued with equanimity.

Likewise the second direction.

Likewise the third direction.

Likewise the fourth direction.

Thus above, below, across, everywhere, completely, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill-will.

"Just as, Vāseṭṭha, a strong trumpeter might easily make himself heard in the four directions.

Just so, Vāseṭṭha, by this cultivation of equanimity, that liberation of the heart whereby any action that is of limited extent no longer remains, no longer persists there.

This too, Vāseṭṭha, is the path to companionship with Brahmā.

"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha, is a *bhikkhu* living thus encumbered or unencumbered?" "Unencumbered, revered Gotama."

"With a mind of hatred or without hatred?" "Without hatred, revered Gotama."

"With a mind of ill-will or without ill-will?" "Without ill-will, revered Gotama."

"With a defiled mind or an undefiled mind?" "With an undefiled mind, revered Gotama."

"Disciplined or undisciplined?" "Disciplined, revered Gotama."

"Thus, Vāseṭṭha, an unencumbered *bhikkhu* is like unencumbered Brahmā.

Does an unencumbered *bhikkhu* have communion or fellowship with the unencumbered Brahmā?" "Yes, revered Gotama."

"Well done, Vāseṭṭha! It is possible that an unencumbered *bhikkhu*, upon the breakup of the body, after death, will attain companionship with the unencumbered Brahmā."

558.

"Thus, Vāseṭṭha, a *bhikkhu* without hatred is like Brahmā without hatred…pe… a *bhikkhu* without ill-will is like Brahmā without ill-will… a *bhikkhu* with an undefiled mind is like Brahmā with an undefiled mind… a disciplined *bhikkhu* is like a disciplined Brahmā. Is it possible that a disciplined *bhikkhu* could have communion or fellowship with a disciplined Brahmā?" "Yes, revered Gotama."

"Well done, Vāseṭṭha! It is possible that a disciplined *bhikkhu*, upon the breakup of the body, after death, will attain companionship with the disciplined Brahmā."

559.

When this was said, the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said this to the Blessed One: "Excellent, revered Gotama, excellent, revered Gotama! It is as if someone were to set upright what had been overthrown, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the way to one who was lost, or to hold up an oil lamp in the dark, so that those with eyes could see.

In just this way the Dhamma has been elucidated in many ways by the esteemed Gotama.</div>
