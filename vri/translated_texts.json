    "commentary_english": "378. Thus have I heard…pe… the Jāliya Sutta at Kosambī.\n\nHerein is an explanation of words not previously [encountered].\n\n\"Ghositārāma\" means in the ārāma made by the wealthy man Ghosita.\n\nFormerly, it seems, it was called Allakapparaṭṭha.\n\nThen, a poor man named Kotūhalika, going to the country of Avanti with his wife and children, because of fear of hunger, being unable to carry his son, abandoned him and went on. The mother, turning back, took him and left. They entered a cowherd village.\n\nAnd then much rice-gruel (pāyāsa) was prepared by the cowherd, and they, obtaining the rice-gruel from there, ate it.\n\nThen that man, having eaten a large amount of rice-gruel and being unable to digest it, died during the night and was reborn in that very place in the womb of a bitch, and became a dog. He was dear to the cowherd.\n\nAnd the cowherd attended upon a private Buddha (paccekabuddha).\n\nAnd that private Buddha, at the end of the mealtime, gave the dog a lump [of food] each time, and having aroused affection in the private Buddha, he went to the leaf-hut together with the cowherd.\n\nWhen the cowherd was not present, at mealtime, he himself would go and bark at the leaf-hut door to announce the time [for alms], and even on the road in between, having seen fierce animals, he would bark and drive them away.\n\nHe, with a softened heart toward the private Buddha, at the end of his life, was reborn in the world of the gods.\n\nThere his name was indeed Ghosakadevaputta.\n\nHe, having passed away from the world of the gods, was reborn in Kosambī in the house of a certain family.\n\nThat childless wealthy man, having given wealth to his mother and father, adopted him as his son.\n\nThen, when his own sons were born, he attempted to have him killed seven times.\n\nHe, because of his merit, not attaining death in even seven places, at the end, having his life saved through the cleverness of a certain wealthy man's daughter, in a later part, through the death of his father, having attained the position of a wealthy man, became known as the wealthy man Ghosaka.\n\nAlso, in Kosambī there were two other wealthy men, Kukkuṭaseṭṭhi and Pāvāriyaseṭṭhi; with this one, they were three.\n\nAnd at that time, five hundred ascetics from the Himalayas, for the sake of appeasing their bodies, would come to Kosambī from time to time, and these three wealthy men, having made leaf huts in their own gardens, would attend upon them.\n\nThen one day, those ascetics, coming from the Himalayas, tired and thirsty in the great wilderness, having reached a large banyan tree, sat down there, expecting support from the deity residing there.\n\nThe deity, having extended a hand adorned with all ornaments, gave them drinking water, beverages, etc., and relieved their weariness. These [ascetics], astonished by the power of the deity, asked: \"What good deed, O deity, have you done, by which this success has been obtained by you?\" The deity said: \"In the world a Buddha named the Blessed One has arisen; he now dwells in Sāvatthī, and Anāthapiṇḍika the householder attends upon him.\n\nHe, on the uposatha days, having given only their usual food wages to his servants, has the uposatha observed.\n\nThen one day, at midday, having come for breakfast, I saw some servant not doing any work, and asked: 'Why are people not working today?'\n\nThey announced that matter to me.\n\nThen I said this: 'Now half the day has passed; is it possible to do a half-uposatha?'\n\nThen, having informed the wealthy man, he said, 'It is possible to do it.'\n\nI, having undertaken a half-day, half-uposatha, and having died that very day, have obtained this success.\"\n\nThen those ascetics, \"A Buddha, it seems, has arisen!\" with joy and delight having arisen, though desiring to go to Sāvatthī from there, [thought]: \"These wealthy men who are our supporters have done much for us. We will announce this matter to them also,\" and having gone to Kosambī, after being honored and respected by the wealthy men, they said, \"We will go this very day.\"\n\n\"Why, venerable sirs, are you in such a hurry? Didn't you formerly stay four or five months and then leave?\" And when this was said, they announced that event.\n\n\"Then, venerable sirs, let us go together!\" And when this was said, \"We will go, you come slowly,\" having gone to Sāvatthī, having gone forth in the presence of the Blessed One, they attained arahantship.\n\nThose wealthy men also, with a retinue of five hundred carts each, having gone to Sāvatthī, having given donations, etc., and having requested the Blessed One for the sake of coming to Kosambī, having come back, had three monasteries built.\n\nAmong them, the Kukkuṭārāma was made by Kukkuṭaseṭṭhi, the Pāvārikambavana was made by Pāvāriyaseṭṭhi, the Ghositārāma was made by Ghositaseṭṭhi.\n\nWith reference to that, it was said: \"He dwells in Kosambī, in the Ghositārāma.\"\n\n\"Muṇḍiya\" – this is his name.\n\n\"Jāliya\" – this also is the name of the other.\n\nSince his preceptor wanders for alms with a bowl made of wood, therefore he is called Dārupattikantevāsī.\n\n\"They said this\" means that, desiring to bring forward a dispute with an intention to scold, they said this.\n\nThus, it seems, was their [intention]: \"If the Śramaṇa Gotama says, 'The life is the same as the body,' then we will bring forward this argument against him: 'O Gotama, in your doctrine, the being is destroyed right here, therefore your doctrine is a doctrine of annihilation.'\"\n\n\"If, however, he says, 'The life is one thing, the body is another,' then we will bring forward this argument against him: 'In your doctrine, the form is destroyed, not the being.\n\nTherefore, in your doctrine, the being becomes eternal.'\"\nThen the Blessed One thought, \"These (people) are asking a question for the purpose of introducing a debate. They do not know that in my teaching there is a middle path (*madhyamā pratipadā*) without approaching these two extremes (*dve ante*). Come, having answered their question, I will teach the Dharma (*dharmaṃ deśemi*) for the sake of revealing that very path.\" Having thought this, he said, \"Then, friend,\" and so on.",

    "commentary_english": "1.  There, *evaṃ* is a particle.\n*Meti* and others are nouns.\nIn \"he has undertaken,\" *paṭi-* is a prefix, and *hoti* is a verb.\nIn this way, the division of words should be understood.\nIn meaning, however, the word *evaṃ* has various meanings, such as comparison, instruction, praise, reproach, acceptance of a statement, mode, demonstration, and ascertainment.\nLikewise, it was said, \"Having been born thus, a mortal should do much good\" (Dha.\np.\n53), it comes in comparison and so on.\n\"Thus should you move forward, thus should you move backward\" and so on (A.\nN.\n4.\n122) in instruction.\n\"So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Well-Gone\" and so on (A.\nN.\n3.\n66) in praise.\n\"Thus, in this way, this wretched woman praises that shaven ascetic, whatever or whoever he may be\" and so on (Saṃ.\nN.\n1.\n187) in reproach.\n\"So it is, venerable sir,\" thus those monks replied to the Blessed One and so on (M.\nN.\n1.\n1) in acceptance of a statement.\n\"Thus, indeed, venerable sir, do I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One\" and so on (M.\nN.\n1.\n398) in mode.\n\"Come, young man, go to the *śramaṇa* Ānanda; having gone, ask the *śramaṇa* Ānanda in my name whether he is free from affliction, free from ailment, quickly rising, strong, and living in comfort.\n\"Subha, the young man Todeyyaputta, asks the venerable Ānanda whether he is free from affliction, free from ailment, quickly rising, strong, and living in comfort.\"\n\"And say thus: 'May the venerable Ānanda, out of compassion, come to the dwelling of Subha, the young man Todeyyaputta,'\" and so on (D.\nN.\n1.\n445) in demonstration.\n\"What do you think, O Kālāmas, are these things wholesome *kuśala* or unwholesome *akuśala*?\" \"Unwholesome *akuśala*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Are they blameworthy *sāvajja* or blameless *anavajja*?\" \"Blameworthy *sāvajja*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Are they censured by the wise *viññugarahita* or praised by the wise *viññuppasattha*?\" \"Censured by the wise *viññugarahita*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Being undertaken and put into effect, do they lead to harm and suffering *duḥkha*, or not, or how does it appear to you in this case?\" \"Being undertaken and put into effect, venerable sir, they lead to harm and suffering *duḥkha*; thus it appears to us in this case\" and so on (A.\nN.\n3.66) In the sense of emphasis.\n\nHere, it should be viewed as an instance of mode, illustration and emphasis.\n\nHerein, in the sense of mode, he illustrates this meaning by the word \"thus\". [The meaning is that the Blessed One's word] is skillful in many methods (nānānayanipuṇa), arises from diverse inclinations (anekajjhāsayasamuṭṭhānaṃ), is endowed with meaning and expression (atthabyañjanasampannaṃ), possesses various marvels (vividhapāṭihāriyaṃ), is profound in teaching and penetrating ideas and meanings (dhammatthadesanāpaṭivedhagambhīraṃ), and comes to the ear of all beings (sabbasattānaṃ) in accordance with their own language (sakasakabhāsānurūpato). Who is capable of understanding it in every way (sabbappakārena)? However, by arousing the desire to hear in every way (sabbathāmena), [it is said] 'Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),' and 'I also heard (mayāpi evaṃ suta) in one way (ekena ākārena.'\n\nIn the sense of demonstration, excluding himself by saying, \"I am not self-become (nāhaṃ sayambhū), nor has this been realized by me (na mayā idaṃ sacchikata),\" he demonstrates the entire *sūtra* (sakalaṃ suttaṃ) that is to be spoken now, [saying] \"Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),\" \"I also heard (mayāpi evaṃ suta).\"\n\nIn the sense of emphasis, [it is said,] \"Monks, this Ānanda is foremost among my disciples who are learned (bahussutānaṃ), endowed with *gati*, *sati*, and *dhiti*, and attendants (upaṭṭhākānaṃ),\" (A.N. 1.223).\n\nThus, by the Blessed One: “The venerable Ānanda is skilled in meaning (*arthakusala*), skilled in Dharma (*dharmakusala*), skilled in expression (*byañjanakusala*), skilled in etymology (*niruttikusala*), skilled in what precedes and what follows (*pubbāparakusala*),\" (A.N. 5.169).\n\nThus, the general of the Dharma (dhammasenāpatinā), showing his strength of memory (dhāraṇabalaṃ) in accordance with the commended state (pasatthabhāvānurūpaṃ), generates a desire to hear in beings (sattānaṃ sotukāmataṃ janeti), [saying] \"Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),\" and \"That, indeed, is neither less nor more in meaning or expression (atthato vā byañjanato vā anūnamanadhikaṃ), and it should be regarded exactly thus (evameva na aññathā daṭṭhabba).\"\n\nThe word \"me\" (me-saddo) appears in three senses (tīsu atthesu dissati).\n\nThus, in passages such as \"What has been earned by stanzas is uneatable by me (gāthābhigītaṃ me abhojaneyya),\" (S.N. 81) the meaning is \"by me (mayā).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Venerable Sir (bhante), may the Blessed One (bhagavā) teach me the Dharma (dhammaṃ desetū) in brief (saṅkhittena),\" (S.N. 4.88) the meaning is \"to me (mayhaṃ).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Monks (bhikkhave), be my heirs in Dharma (dhammadāyādā me),\" (M.N. 1.29) the meaning is \"of me (mama).\"\n\nHere, however, \"by me heard (mayā sutaṃ)\" and \"my heard (mama sutaṃ)\" are appropriate in two meanings (atthadvaye yujjati).\n\nHere, *suta*, this word *suta*, with and without prefixes (*saupasaggo ca anupasaggo ca*)—[has] various kinds of meanings (anekatthappabhedo), such as going, celebrated, stained, accumulated, application, knowable by the ear, following the ear-door, known, and so forth—thus, in passages such as \"Urging the army (senāya pasuto),\" the meaning is \"going (gacchanto).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Of one who sees the heard Dharma (sutadhammassa passato),\" (Udā. 11) the meaning is \"of the celebrated Dharma (vissutadhammassa).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Flowed out, of one who has flowed out (avassutā avassutassā),\" (Pāci. 657) the meaning is \"of one stained and unstained (kilinnākilinnassa).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Merit has been produced by you, no little (tumhehi puññaṃ pasutaṃ anappaka),\" (Khu. Pā. 7.12) the meaning is \"accumulated (upacitaṃ).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Those steadfast ones intent on *jhāna* (ye jhānapasutā dhīrā),\" (Dha. Pa. 181) the meaning is \"devoted to *jhāna* (*jhānānuyuttā*).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Seen, heard, sensed (diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ muta),\" (M.\nni.\n1.\n2.  241) *sotaviññeyyanti attho*: the meaning is, cognizable by the ear.\n‘‘*sutadharo sutasannicayo*’’*tiādīsu* (ma.: in such passages as 'he remembers what he has heard, stores up what he has heard' (etc.).\nni.\n1.\n2.  339) *sotadvārānusāraviññātadharoti attho*: the meaning is, one who bears in mind what is cognized in the ear-door.\n*idha panassa sotadvārānusārena upadhāritanti vā upadhāraṇanti vāti attho*: But here the meaning of *sutam* is properly ‘what has been recorded by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness’, or it is the ‘act of recording’.\n*‘me’ saddassa hi ‘mayā’ti atthe sati ‘evaṃ mayā sutaṃ’ sotadvārānusārena upadhāritanti yujjati*: ‘me’ means ‘by me’; thus when there is the meaning of ‘by me’, it is fitting [to say] ‘*evaṃ mayā sutaṃ*’ what has been recorded by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness.\n*‘mamā’ti atthe sati evaṃ mama sutaṃ sotadvārānusārena upadhāraṇanti yujjati*: ‘mine’ means when there is the meaning of ‘mine,’ thus ‘*evaṃ mama sutaṃ*’ is fitting as the act of recording by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness.\n*evametesu tīsu padesu evanti sotaviññāṇādiviññāṇakiccanidassanaṃ*: So as regards these three words, *evam* is the demonstration of consciousness’s function as ear-consciousness, etc.\n*meti vuttaviññāṇasamaṅgipuggalanidassanaṃ*: and *me* demonstrates a person connected with the described consciousness.\n*sutanti assavanabhāvapaṭikkhepato anūnādhikāviparītaggahaṇanidassanaṃ*: while *sutam* is a demonstration of grasping what is neither deficient nor excessive nor distorted, because it rejects the state of non-hearing.\n*tathā evanti tassā sotadvārānusārena pavattāya viññāṇavīthiyā nānappakārena ārammaṇe pavattibhāvappakāsanaṃ*: Similarly, *evam* demonstrates that the kinds of cognizance beginning with hearing have actually occurred in the various ways with respect to an object by the description of the modes of the cognitive series 17 that has occurred by means of the ear-consciousness.\n*meti attappakāsanaṃ*: *me* demonstrates an individual self.\n*sutanti dhammappakāsanaṃ*: and *sutam* demonstrates an idea.\n*ayañhettha saṅkhepo – ‘‘nānappakārena ārammaṇe pavattāya viññāṇavīthiyā mayā na aññaṃ kataṃ, idaṃ pana kataṃ, ayaṃ dhammo suto’’ti*: Herein this is the summary: “Nothing else was done by me with the cognitive series that has occurred in the various ways with respect to an object; but this was done; this idea was cognized.”\n*tathā evanti niddisitabbadhammappakāsanaṃ*: Similarly, *evam* demonstrates something about to be demonstrated.\n*meti puggalappakāsanaṃ*: *me* demonstrates a person.\n*sutanti puggalakiccappakāsanaṃ*: and *sutam* demonstrates the person’s function.\n*idaṃ vuttaṃ hoti*: This is what is said:\n*‘‘yaṃ suttaṃ niddisissāmi, taṃ mayā evaṃ suta’’nti*: “That *sūtra* which I will indicate, that was thus heard by me”.\n*tathā evanti yassa cittasantānassa nānākārappavattiyā nānatthabyañjanaggahaṇaṃ hoti, tassa nānākāraniddeso*: Similarly, *evam* is the various demonstration of one whose mind-continuum has a grasp of various meanings and expressions from the occurrence of various modes.\n*evanti hi ayamākārapaññatti*: *evam* is indeed the description of this mode.\n*meti kattuniddeso*: *me* demonstrates an agent.\n*sutanti visayaniddeso*: *sutam* demonstrates an object.\n*ettāvatā nānākārappavattena cittasantānena taṃ samaṅgino kattu visayaggahaṇasanniṭṭhānaṃ kataṃ hoti*: To this extent, by the mind-continuum that occurs in various modes, the establishment of the agent's grasp of the object is done by him who is connected with it.\n*athavā evanti puggalakiccaniddeso*: Or, *evam* demonstrates a person’s function.\n*sutanti viññāṇakiccaniddeso*: *sutam* demonstrates consciousness’s function.\n*meti ubhayakiccayuttapuggalaniddeso*: and *me* demonstrates a person connected with both these functions.\n*ayaṃ panettha saṅkhepo, ‘‘mayā savanakiccaviññāṇasamaṅginā puggalena viññāṇavasena laddhasavanakiccavohārena suta’’nti*: Herein, this is the summary, “By me, a person connected with consciousness functioning as hearing, by means of consciousness, by a term for a function of acquired hearing, [it was] cognized”.\n*tattha evanti ca meti ca saccikaṭṭhaparamatthavasena avijjamānapaññatti*: Herein, the words *evam* and *me* are, in the true sense and ultimate sense, a description in terms of the non- factual.\n*kiñhettha taṃ paramatthato atthi, yaṃ evanti vā meti vā niddesaṃ labhetha? sutanti vijjamānapaññatti*: What, herein, exists in the ultimate sense, that could obtain a demonstration such as *evam* or *me*? while *sutam* is a description in terms of the factual.\n*yañhi taṃ ettha sotena upaladdhaṃ, taṃ paramatthato vijjamānanti*: Because, indeed, that which is perceived here by the ear is, in the ultimate sense, factual.\n*tathā ‘eva’nti ca, meti ca, taṃ taṃ upādāya vත්තබ්ବతో upādāpaññatti*: Similarly, *evam* and *me* are a derivative description because they are stated derivatively upon this or that fact.\n*‘suta’nti diṭṭhādīni upanidhāya vत्तබ්බతో upanidhāpaññatti*: while *sutam* is an appositional description because it that is, the heard, is so called in apposition to the seen and the rest.\n*ettha ca evanti vacanena asammohaṃ dīpeti*: Here too, by the word *evam* he points out non-confusion.\n*na hi sammūḷho nānappakārapaṭivedhasamattho hoti*: For someone who is confused is not capable of penetration of difference in kind.\n*‘suta’nti vacanena sutassa asammosaṃ dīpeti*: By the word *sutam* he points out non-forgetting of what was heard.\n*yassa hi sutaṃ sammuṭṭhaṃ hoti, na so kālantarena mayā sutanti paṭijānāti*: Because, someone whose hearing is forgotten, does not acknowledge after a time has elapsed: ‘I heard [this]’.\nThrough non-confusion, there is accomplishment of wisdom (*paññā-siddhi*); however, through non-forgetfulness, there is accomplishment of mindfulness (*sati-siddhi*).\n\nThere, with mindfulness preceded by wisdom, there is the ability to ascertain the letters (*byañjanāvadhāraṇa-samatthatā*); with wisdom preceded by mindfulness, there is the ability to penetrate the meaning (*attha-paṭivedha-samatthatā*).\n\nThrough the power of both these abilities, there is accomplishment of being a custodian of the *dharma*-treasure (*dharma-bhāṇḍāgārika-tta-siddhi*), due to the ability to preserve the *dharma*-treasury (*dharma-kośa*) which is endowed with meaning and letters (*attha-byañjana-sampannassa*).\n\nAnother way: by the word *evaṃ*, he indicates reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāraṃ dīpeti*).\n\nIndeed, because of the absence of various kinds of penetration, [that comes] from not giving reasoned attention (*ayoniso manasi-karoto hi nānappakāra-paṭivedhābhāvato*).\n\nBy the word *sutaṃ*, he indicates non-distraction (*avikkhepaṃ dīpeti*), because hearing is absent in one whose mind is distracted (*vikkhitta-cittassa savanābhāvato*).\n\nFor example, a distracted person, even when being told everything, says, \"I did not hear it; say it again.\"\n\nAnd through reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikārena*), here he establishes right self-direction (*attasammāpaṇidhiṃ*) and previously performed merit (*katapuññataṃ*), because of the absence of that (*tadabhāvato*) in one who is wrongly directed (*sammā appaṇihita-attassa*) and has not performed merit previously (*akatapuññassa vā*).\n\nThrough non-distraction (*avikkhepena*), he establishes hearing the true *dharma* (*saddhammassavanaṃ*) and reliance on true men (*sappurisūpanissayañca*).\n\nFor a distracted person is not able to hear, nor is there hearing for one who does not attend upon true men.\n\nAnother way: because by *evaṃ*, the grasping of various meanings and letters (*nānā-attha-byañjana-ggahaṇaṃ*) occurs to the mind-stream (*citta-santānassa*) with various kinds of activity (*nānākāra-ppavattiyā*), therefore it is said to be a designation of various kinds (*nānākāra-niddeso*). But that good form (*bhaddako ākāro*) does not occur for one who is wrongly directed (*sammā appaṇihita-attano*) and has not previously performed merit (*akatapuññassa vā*); therefore by this good form (*iminā bhaddakenākārena*) he indicates the attainment of the two subsequent wheels (*pacchimacakka-dvaya-sampattiṃ*).\n\n*Sutaṃ* [indicates] the attainment of the two prior wheels (*purimacakkadvayasampattiṃ*) through the practice of hearing (*savana-yogena*).\n\nIndeed, there is no hearing (*savanaṃ natthi*) for one dwelling in an unsuitable place (*appatirūpa-dese vasato*) or who is without reliance on true men (*sappurisūpanissaya-virahitassa vā*).\n\nThrough the accomplishment of the two subsequent wheels (*pacchima-cakka-dvaya-siddhiyā*), there is the accomplishment of purity of intention (*āśaya-śuddhi-siddhā hoti*); through the accomplishment of the two prior wheels (*purima-cakka-dvaya-siddhiyā*), there is purity of practice (*prayoga-śuddhi*). And through that purity of intention (*tāya ca āśaya-śuddhiyā*), there is accomplishment of manifest realization (*adhigama-byatti-siddhi*); through purity of practice (*prayoga-śuddhiyā*), there is accomplishment of manifest tradition (*āgama-byatti-siddhi*).\n\nThus, the speech (*vacanaṃ*) of one whose practice and intention are pure (*payoga-āśaya-śuddhasa*) and who is endowed with tradition and realization (*āgama-adhigama-sampannassa*), like the first light of dawn (*aruṇuggaṃ viya*) from the rising of the sun (*sūriyassa udayato*), and like reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāro viya ca*) to wholesome action (*kuśala-kammassa*), he establishes the cause (*nidānaṃ ṭhapento*) in a suitable place (*ṭhāne*), [saying]: \"*Evaṃ me sutaṃ* – Thus have I heard.\" He said, beginning with that, that it is fitting to precede the word of the Blessed One (*arhati bhagavato vacanassa pubbaṅgamaṃ bhavituṃ*).\n\nAnother way: by the word *evaṃ*, with this word that illuminates various kinds of penetration (*iminā nānāppakāra-paṭivedha-dīpakena vacanena*), he indicates the complete presence of his own skillful understanding of meaning and analytical insight (*attano attha-paṭibhāna-paṭisambhidā-sampatti-sabbhāvaṃ dīpeti*).\n\n*Sutaṃ* [indicates] the complete presence of analytical insight and skillful expression of *dharma* in a way that illuminates the divisions of what is to be heard (*sotabba-ppabheda-paṭivedha-dīpakena dhamma-nirutti-paṭisambhidā-sampatti-sabbhāvaṃ*).\n\nAnd *evaṃ*—illuminating reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāra-dīpakaṃ*)—uttering the word *idaṃ*, he indicates: \"These *dharmas* have been considered by me in my mind, [and] are well-penetrated by insight\" (*ete mayā dhammā manasānupekkhitā, diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā*).\n\n*Sutaṃ*—illuminating the practice of hearing (*savana-yoga-dīpakaṃ*)—uttering the word *idaṃ*, he indicates: \"Many *dharmas* have been heard by me, retained, [and] consolidated by word\" (*bahū mayā dhammā sutā dhātā vacasā paricitā*).\n\nBy both of these, showing the completeness of meaning and letter (*attha-byañjana-pāripūriṃ dīpento*), he generates reverence in hearing (*savane ādaraṃ janeti*).\n\nFor indeed, one who does not respectfully listen to the *dharma* that is complete in meaning and letter (*attha-byañjana-paripuṇṇaṃ hi dhammaṃ ādarena assuṇanto*) is excluded from great benefit (*mahatā hitā paribāhiro hoti*); therefore, generating reverence (*ādaraṃ janetvā*), this *dharma* should be heard carefully (*sakkaccaṃ ayaṃ dhammo sotabbo*).\n\n\"Thus I have heard (*evaṃ me sutaṃ*)\"—by this entire utterance (*iminā pana sakalena vacanena*), the venerable Ānanda, not appropriating to himself the *dharma* proclaimed by the *Tathāgata* (*tathāgata-ppaveditaṃ dhammaṃ attano adahanto*), transcends the plane of those who are not true men (*asappurisa-bhūmiṃ atikkamati*).\n\nAcknowledging discipleship (*sāvakattaṃ paṭijānanto*), he descends to the plane of true men (*sappurisa-bhūmiṃ okkamati*).\n\nThus, he has his mind emerge from what is not the true *dharma* (*asaddhammā cittaṃ vuṭṭhāpeti*), [and] he establishes his mind in the true *dharma* (*saddhamme cittaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti*).\n\n\"All this has been heard by me, [and] is the word of the Blessed One\" (*kevalaṃ sutam-ev-etaṃ mayā, tassa-eva bhagavato vacanaṃ*)—showing this (*dīpento*), he frees himself (*attānaṃ parimoceti*), he bears witness to the Teacher (*satthāraṃ apadisati*), he applies the Victor's word (*jinavacanaṃ appeti*), [and] he establishes the guide of the *dharma* (*dhamma-nettiṃ patiṭṭhāpeti*).\n\nMoreover, \"Thus I have heard (*evaṃ me sutaṃ*)\"—not claiming it to be produced by himself (*attanā uppāditabhāvaṃ appaṭijānanto*), clarifying the prior utterance (*purimaṃ vacanaṃ vivaranto*)—\"This has been received by me directly (*sammukhā paṭiggahitam idaṃ mayā*) from that Blessed One who is confident in the four grounds for confidence (*catu-vesārajja-visāradassa*), the possessor of the ten powers (*dasa-bala-dharassa*), abiding in the place of a bull (*āsabha-ṭṭhāna-ṭṭhāyino*), with the sound of a lion's roar and so forth (*sīhanāda-nādino*), the best of all beings (*sabba-sattu-ttamassa*), the lord of the *dharma* (*dhamm-issarassa*), the king of the *dharma* (*dhamma-rājassa*), the master of the *dharma* (*dhammādhipatino*), the lamp of the *dharma* (*dhamma-dīpassa*), the refuge of the *dharma* (*dhamma-saraṇassa*), the best wheel-turner of the true *dharma* (*saddhamma-vara-cakka-vattino*), the perfectly awakened one (*sammā-sambuddhassa vacanaṃ*)—\"Here, there should not be doubt or uncertainty (*na ettha atthe vā dhamme vā pade vā byañjane vā kaṅkhā vā vimati vā kātabbā*).\" He destroys the lack of faith in this *dharma* in all gods and humans (*sabbesaṃ deva-manussānaṃ imasmiṃ dhamme assaddhiyaṃ vināseti*), [and] he generates the accomplishment of faith (*saddhā-sampadaṃ uppādeti*).\n\nTherefore this is said: *ekaṃ*—a designation that is a reckoning and a demarcation (*gaṇana-pariccheda-niddeso*).\n\n*Samayanti*—a demarcated designation (*paricchinna-niddeso*).\n\n*Ekaṃ samayanti*—an indefinite illumination (*aniyamita-paridīpanaṃ*).\n\nThere, the word *samaya*—thus his—\"Perhaps we may approach him again tomorrow, taking time and occasion into consideration (*appeva-nāma svepi upasaṅkameyyāma kālañca samayañca upādāya*)”\" (D.\nN.\n1.\n447) is the meaning of combination (*samavāyo attho*).\n\n\"There is only one moment and occasion, *bhikkhus*, for living the holy life (*ekova kho bhikkhave, khaṇo ca samayo ca brahmacariya-vāsāyā*)\" (A.\nN.\n8.\n29) [is] the moment (*khaṇo*).\n\n\"*Uṇha-samayo pariḷāha-samayo*—It is the hot season, it is the burning season\" (Pāci.\n358) [is] time (*kālo*).\n\n\"*Mahāsamayo pavanasmi*—A great occasion in the forest\" (D.\nNi.\n2.\n332) A collection.\n\"Also, Bhaddali, this circumstance was not recognised by you: 'The Blessed One is living at Sāvatthi, and the Blessed One will know me thus: \"The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.\"'\nThis circumstance too, Bhaddali, was not recognised by you\" and so forth (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n135) A cause.\n\"Now on that occasion the Wanderer Samanama-ndikaputta was staying in Mallika’s Single-hall Tinduka-tree-plantation Park for Debating Opinions\" and so forth (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n260) A view.\nThere, although in these occasions beginning with year, whatever sutta was spoken in whichever year, season, month, fortnight, night or day, all that is well-known and well-established in wisdom to the Elder.\nBecause, however – \"Thus I have heard\" in such-and-such year, in such-and-such season, in such-and-such month, in such-and-such fortnight, in such-and-such part of the night, in such-and-such part of the day – when it is said thus, it is not possible to retain it easily or to recite it, or to have it recited, and much has to be said, therefore having summarized that meaning in one word, he said \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nOr else what is meant is: among the Blessed One’s several times specially evident to gods and men and counted as Occasions, such as the Occasion of the Conception in the Womb ( *gabbhokkantisamaya* ), Occasion of the Birth ( *jātisamaya* ), Occasion of the Sense of Urgency ( *saṃvegasamaya* ), Occasion of the Renunciation ( *abhinikkhamanasamaya* ), Occasion of the Austerities ( *dukkarakārikāsamaya* ), Occasion of the Conquest of Māra ( *māravijayasamaya* ), Occasion of the Enlightenment ( *abhisambodhisamaya* ), Occasion of the Pleasant Abiding Here and Now ( *diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārasamaya* ), Occasion of the Teaching ( *desanāsamaya* ), Occasion of the Final Extinction ( *parinibbānasamaya* ).\nAmong these occasions, he indicates that the Occasion of Teaching ( *desanāsamaya* ) is called \"one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nAnd that occasion of compassionate action among occasions of knowledge and compassionate action, the occasion of practice beneficial to others among occasions of practice beneficial to oneself and to others, the occasion of Dhamma talk among occasions of two duties that should be done by those assembled, the occasion of teaching among occasions of practice of teaching, also with reference to those occasions, he said \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nWhy is the accusative case used here, as in the Abhidhamma, \"when the realm of desire\" ( *yasmiṃ samaye kāmāvacaraṃ* ) (Dha.\nSa.\n1) and, in other Sutta passages, \"when, monks, a monk is secluded from desires\" ( *yasmiṃ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi* ) is the locative case used, and in the Vinaya, \"at that time the Buddha, the Blessed One\" ( *tena samayena buddho bhagavā* ) is the instrumental case used, and not having done so, why is the accusative case \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) used? There, it is so because the meaning is possible in different ways here and there.\nFor there, in the Abhidhamma and in other Sutta passages, the meaning of the locative case as a container and the meaning of characterization of one substantive by another substantive are possible.\nNow the locative case is the time, and the Occasion is a collection; there, the nature of those things beginning with contact, which are stated there, is characterized by the nature of the Occasion, which is called a moment, an event, and a cause, therefore the locative case is used there to illuminate that meaning.\nAnd in the Vinaya, the meaning of the instrumental case is that of cause and reason.\nFor that Occasion of the proclamation of the training precept, which is difficult to know even for Sāriputta and others, the Blessed One, making known the training precepts on that occasion, which was the cause and the reason, and expecting the cause of the proclamation of the training precept, dwelt there and there, therefore the instrumental case is used there to illuminate that meaning.\nHere, however, and in other similar passages, the meaning of direct governance is possible.\nFor when the Blessed One taught this or any other Sutta, he dwelt on that occasion entirely in an abode of compassion, therefore the accusative case is used here to illuminate that meaning.\nTherefore, it is said thus: But the ancients explain it, \"At that time\" ( *tasmiṃ samaye* ) or, \"By that time\" ( *tena samayena* ) or, \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ), this is merely a difference in expression, the meaning is the same everywhere.\nTherefore, even when \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) is said, the meaning should be understood as \"At one occasion\" ( *ekasmiṃ samaye* ).\n*Bhagavā* is revered.\nFor in the world, they call the *Bhagavā* revered.\nAnd this one is revered by all beings because of being distinguished by all qualities, therefore he should be understood as the *Bhagavā*.\nIt has also been said by the ancients – and also – the meaning of the expansion of the meaning of the word according to this verse should be understood.\nAnd that has already been said in the section on recollection of the Buddha in the *Visuddhimagga*.\nThus far, by the words \"Thus I have heard\" here, showing the Dhamma as it was heard, he makes the *Dhammakāya* of the Blessed One manifest.\nTherefore, by the Teacher's not being seen, he consoles the people who are longing [for him], [saying] \"This is not a teaching with a passed-away teacher, this is your Teacher\" ( *ayaṃ vo satthā* ).\nBy the words \"On one occasion the Blessed One\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā* ), showing the non-existence of the Blessed One at that time, he establishes the *parinibbāna* of the *rūpakāya*.\nTherefore, \"Such a one, the teacher of the noble Dhamma, the possessor of the ten powers, whose body is like a mass of diamonds, even that Blessed One has attained *parinibbāna*, by what other should hope be generated in life?\" Thus he stirs up the people who are intoxicated with the pride of life, and he generates enthusiasm in them for the true Dhamma.\nAnd saying \"Thus\" ( *evaṃ* ), he indicates the accomplishment of the teaching ( *desanāsampattiṃ* ).\n\"Thus I have heard\" ( *me sutaṃ* ) is the accomplishment of a listener ( *sāvakasampattiṃ* ).\n\"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) is the accomplishment of time ( *kālasampattiṃ* ).\nand by the words “the Exalted One,” that it possesses a teacher.\nAnd between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda, the word *antarā* appears in the meanings of cause, moment, mind, middle, interval, and so on.\n\"Who would know that interval apart from the *Tathāgatas*?\" (A.\nNipāta 6.\n44) and, \"When people meet and discuss, what is the interval between you and me?\" (Saṃyutta Nikāya 1.\n228) and so on, the word *antarā* is [used] in the sense of cause.\n\"A certain woman saw me by a flash of lightning, O Blessed One, washing a pot\" etc. (Majjhima Nikāya 2.\n149) [is used in the sense of] moment.\n\"For whom there is no anger within\" etc. (Udāna 20) [is used in the sense of] mind (*citta*).\n\"The end came in between\" etc. (Cūḷavagga 350) [is used in the sense of] middle (*vemajjhe*).\n\"But the Tapodā runs between two great hells, monks\" etc. (Pārājika 231) [is used in the sense of] interval (*vivare*).\nNow, it exists in this interval, therefore, the interval between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda, thus the meaning here should be understood.\nBecause it is associated with the word *antarā*, the expression \"upayoga\" is made.\nAnd in such places, those who contemplate letters use only one word *antarā* \"he goes between the village and the river\" thus, that should be connected even with the second word. If it is not connected, the expression \"upayoga\" is not obtained.\nHere, however, it is said having connected [the words].\n*Addhānamaggappaṭipanno hoti* means he has undertaken a path known as *addhāna*, the meaning is \"a long path\".\nIn the analysis of the time of going on a long journey, \"I will go half a *yojana*, therefore food should be eaten\" etc. (Pācittiya 218) even half a *yojana* is a long journey.\nNow, from Rājagaha to Nāḷanda is only one *yojana*.\nWith a great monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghena*), 'great' means great by the greatness of virtue (*guṇamahattena*), and great by the greatness of number (*saṅkhyāmahattena*).\nThat monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅgho*) was great also by virtue (*guṇehipi*), because of being endowed with qualities such as fewness of wishes (*appicchatādiguṇasamannāgatattā*).\nIt was also great in number (*saṅkhyāyapi mahā*), being numbered at five hundred (*pañcasatasaṅkhyattā*).\nThe *saṅgha* of *bhikkhus* is the *bhikkhusaṅgho*; by that *bhikkhusaṅghena*.\nThe meaning is a community of ascetics (*samaṇagaṇena*) designated by agreement in views and moral conduct (*diṭṭhisīlasāmaññasaṅghātasaṅkhātena*).\nThe meaning of *saddhinti* is together (*ekato*).\nBy five *matta* hundreds of monks (*bhikkhusatehīti*) means those are five *matta*, therefore they are five *mattas*.\n*Mattā* means *pamāṇa* is said; therefore, just as when it is said \"knowing the measure in food\" (*bhojane mattaññū*), the meaning is \"he knows the measure in food, he knows the *pamāṇa*\", thus here also – \"those five *matta* hundreds of monks are five *pamāṇas*\", thus the meaning should be seen.\nHundreds of monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ satāni*) are monk hundreds (*bhikkhusatāni*), by those five *matta* hundreds of monks (*pañcamattehi bhikkhusatehi*).\n*Suppiyopikho paribbājakoti* means Suppiya is his name.\nThe particle *pi-* has the meaning of combining persons due to being in the same state of having undertaken the path (*maggappaṭipannasabhāgatāya puggalasampiṇḍanattho*).\nThe particle *kho-* makes a connection between words (*padasandhikaro*), [it is] said because of the ease of consonants (*byañjanasiliṭṭhatāvasena vutto*).\n*Paribbājako* means an inhabitant of Sañjaya (*sañjayassa antevāsī*) [is] a wanderer covered [by clothes] (*channaparibbājako*).\nThus it is said: \"When the Blessed One set out on that long road ( *addhānamagga*), then Suppiya the wanderer also set out.\"\nHere, the word *hoti* indicates the past tense.\n*Saddhiṃ antevāsinā brahmadattena māṇavenāti* - *antevāsī* means one who dwells near.\nThe meaning is: a disciple is one who is in close association, who frequents the vicinity.\n*Brahmadatta* is his name.\n*Māṇava* can refer to a noble, a thief, or a youth.\nThere, that is, on that long road, or among those two people.\n*Sudanti* is merely a particle.\n*Anekapariyāyenāti* - the word *pariyāya* occurs in the senses of turn, teaching, and reason (*vāradesanākāraṇesu*).\n\"Whose turn is it today, Ānanda, to advise the nuns?\" and so on.\nni.\n3.\n398) Indeed, the word *pariyāya* functions as a turn.\n\"Bear it in mind as the honey-cake instruction\" and so on.\nni.\n1.\n205) in the teaching.\n\"In this way too, Prince, may it be for a reason\" and so on.\nni.\n2.\n411) in the cause.\nHere too, it functions as cause (*kāraṇe*). Therefore, this is the meaning here: \"By various causes\", \"By many causes\" is said.\n*Buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsatīti* - of the Blessed Buddha, who is without fault and endowed with immeasurable virtues: \"The proper duty towards the elders by birth, such as salutation and respect, is called 'the taste of concord'. The ascetic Gotama does not have this, therefore, the ascetic Gotama is without taste, worthless, an inactionist (*akiriyavādo*), an annihilationist (*ucchedavādo*), disgusting, a trainer, an ascetic, and arrogant.\n\nThe ascetic Gotama has attained no state transcending the merely human level ( *uttarimanussadhamma*), no distinguished knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones (*ariya-ñāṇa-dassana-viseso*).\nThe ascetic Gotama teaches a *dhamma* merely hammered out by reasoning ( *takkapariyāhataṃ*), following his own line of inquiry ( *vīmaṃsānucaritaṃ*), as it occurs to him (*sayaṃpaṭibhānaṃ*).\nThe ascetic Gotama is not omniscient (*sabbaññū*), not a knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), not supreme (*anuttaro*), not the foremost individual (*aggapuggalo*)\".\nThus, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇanti vatvā*), he speaks again and again with disparagement (*avaṇṇaṃ*), fault (*dosaṃ*), and censure (*nindaṃ*).\nJust as he spoke against the Buddha, so too against the *dhamma*, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇato vatvā*) - \"The ascetic Gotama's *dhamma* is wrongly expounded (*durakkhāto*), wrongly penetrated (*duppaṭivedito*), not liberating (*aniyyāniko*), not conducive to peace (*anupasamasaṃvattaniko*)\" - thus, again and again, he speaks disparagingly.\nJust as regarding the *dhamma*, so too regarding the *saṅgha*, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇato vatvā*) - \"The ascetic Gotama's community of disciples (*sāvakasaṅgho*) is practicing wrongly (*micchāpaṭipanno*), perversely (*kuṭilapaṭipanno*), has entered upon a warped (*paccanīkapaṭipadaṃ*), distorted (*ananulomapaṭipadaṃ*), unrighteous (*adhammānulomapaṭipadaṃ*) course of practice\" - thus, again and again, he speaks disparagingly.\nHis pupil, however, [said]: \"Our teacher touches what should not be touched, approaches what should not be approached; like one swallowing fire, like one touching the sharp edge of a sword with his hand, like one wanting to split Mount Meru with his fist, like one playing in a row of saw-like teeth, like one seizing a rutting, fierce elephant with his hand, so he, speaking ill of the Triple Gem (*ratanattaya*) worthy of praise, will incur misfortune and ruin.\nIf the teacher were to tread upon dung, fire, thorns, or a black snake, or to mount a stake, eat deadly poison, step into a violent stream, or throw himself down a cliff, there is no reason for the pupil to follow suit.\nFor beings are the owners of their *kamma* and they each go their own way according to their own *kamma*.\nThe father does not inherit the son’s *kamma*, nor the son the father’s; the mother does not inherit the son’s *kamma*, nor the son the mother’s; the brother does not inherit the sister’s *kamma*, nor the sister the brother’s; the teacher does not inherit the pupil’s *kamma*, nor the pupil the teacher’s.\nMy teacher speaks in dispraise of the Triple Gem (*tiṇṇaṃ ratanānaṃ*); this is a terrible blameworthy deed—the reviling of the *ariyas*.\"\nEmerging from such wise reflections, since he was a naturally intelligent young man, he began to speak in many ways in praise of the Triple Gem (*tiṇṇaṃ ratanānaṃ*), confuting his teacher’s views and supporting himself with cogent reasons.\nThus it was said: \"Suppiya's pupil, Brahmadatta, speaks in various ways in praise of the Buddha, the *Dhamma*, and the *Sangha*.\"\nThere, the word *vaṇṇa* appears in the senses of shape (*saṇṭhāna*), birth (*jāti*), form (*rūpa*), sense-sphere (*āyatana*), cause (*kāraṇa*), measure (*pamāṇa*), quality (*guṇa*), praise (*pasaṃsā*), etc.\nThere, \"Having created a large serpent king's appearance\" and so on.\nni.\n1.\n142) *Saṇṭhānaṃ* is said.\n\"Brahmins are the highest caste (*vaṇṇa*), those of any other *vaṇṇa* are inferior,\" etc. (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n402) *Jāti* (birth, lineage).\n\"Endowed with the utmost beauty of complexion (*vaṇṇapokkharatā*),\" etc. (Dī.\nNi.\n1.\n303) *Rūpāyatanaṃ* (the form sense-sphere).\nThus, these two were pupils of the teacher; thus, these two are pupils of the teacher.\n*Aññamaññassāti añño aññassa*: \"one another\" means one for another.\n*Ujuvipaccanīkavādāti*: *īsakampi apariharitvā ujumeva vividhapaccanīkavādā, anekavāraṃ viruddhavādā eva hutvāti  attho*: meaning that without abandoning even a little, directly [they are] those with diverse opposing views, having many times contradictory views.\nBecause when dispraise (*avaṇṇe*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*) is spoken by the teacher (*ācariyena*), the pupil (*antevāsī*) speaks praise (*vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati*); again, the other [speaks] dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ*), the other [speaks] praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) - thus, the teacher, as if hammering a crooked peg (*visarukkhaāṇiṃ*) on a strong board (*sāraphalake*), repeatedly speaks dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*).\nBut the pupil (*antevāsī*), as if warding off that peg (*taṃ āṇiṃ*) with a peg (*āṇiyā*) made of gold, silver, and jewels (*suvaṇṇarajatamaṇimayāya*), repeatedly speaks praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*).\nTherefore, it was said: \"*Ujuvipaccanīkavādā*.\"\nThey followed (*anubandhā honti*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*) closely (*piṭṭhito piṭṭhito*) and the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghañcāti*); not abandoning (*avijahantā*) the sight (*dassanaṃ*) of the Blessed One (*bhagavantañca*) and the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghañca*) from behind (*pacchato pacchato*), they followed (*anubandhā honti*) with continued deportment (*iriyāpathānubandhanena*), meaning they went (*anugatā hontīti*) having become those who looked after their heads (*sīsānulokino*).\nWhy did the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) set out (*paṭipanno*) on that road (*taṃ addhānaṃ*)? And why did Suppiya (*suppiyo*) follow (*anubandho*)? And why did he (*so*) speak dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ bhāsatīti*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*)? At that time (*tasmiṃ kāle*), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), having dwelt (*vasitvā*) in one (*aññatarasmiṃ*) of the eighteen great monasteries (*aṭṭhārasasu mahāvihāresu*) in the vicinity of Rājagaha (*rājagahaparivattakesu*), early in the morning (*pātova*) having restored his body (*sarīrappaṭijagganaṃ katvā*) and at the time for the alms round (*bhikkhācāravelāyaṃ*), surrounded by the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghaparivuto*), wanders (*carati*) for alms (*piṇḍāya*) in Rājagaha (*rājagaha*).\nHaving made (*katvā*) an easily obtained alms-meal (*sulabhapiṇḍapātaṃ*) for the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghassa*) on that day (*taṃ divasaṃ*), after the meal (*pacchābhattaṃ*) having returned from the alms round (*piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto*), having made (*gāhāpetvā*) the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghaṃ*) bring his bowl and robe (*pattacīvaraṃ*) — \"I will go (*gamissāmi*) to Nāḷanda (*nāḷandaṃ*),\" he said (*iti*), having left (*nikkhamitvā*) Rājagaha (*rājagahato*) he set out (*paṭipanno*) on that road (*taṃ addhānaṃ*).\nAlso, Suppiya (*suppiyopi*), at that time (*tasmiṃ kāle*), having dwelt (*vasitvā*) in one (*aññatarasmiṃ*) of the monasteries (*ārāme*) for wanderers (*paribbājakā*) in the vicinity of Rājagaha (*rājagahaparivattake*), surrounded by wanderers (*paribbājakaparivuto*), wanders (*carati*) for alms (*bhikkhāya*) in Rājagaha (*rājagahe*).\nHe too (*sopi*), having made (*katvā*) an easily obtained alms-meal (*sulabhabhikkhaṃ*) for the wanderers' assembly (*paribbājakaparisāya*) on that day (*taṃ divasaṃ*), having finished his morning meal (*bhuttapātarāso*), having made (*gāhāpetvā*) the wanderers (*paribbājake*) bring his set of wanderer's requisites (*paribbājakaparikkhāraṃ*) - \"I will go (*gamissāmi*) to Nāḷanda (*nāḷandaṃ*),\" he said (*icceva*), not knowing (*ajānantova*) that the Blessed One (*bhagavato*) had set out (*paṭipannabhāvaṃ*) on that road (*taṃ maggaṃ*), he followed (*anubandho*).\nIf he had known (*jāneyya*), he would not have followed (*nānubandheyya*).\nHe, going along (*gacchanto*) unknowingly (*ajānitvāva*), having lifted his neck (*gīvaṃ ukkhipitvā*), looking around (*olokayamāno*), saw (*addasa*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*) shining (*sobhamānaṃ*) with the glory of a Buddha (*buddhasiriyā*), like the shimmering crest (*sikharam*) of a moving golden mountain (*jaṅgamakanakagiriṃ*) enveloped in a red woolen blanket (*rattakambalaparikkhittamiva*).\nAt that time (*tasmiṃ samaye*), it is said (*kira*), having come forth (*nikkhamitvā*) from the body (*sarīrato*) of the Ten-Powered One (*dasabalassa*), six-colored rays (*chabbaṇṇarasmiyo*), all around (*samantā*) in an area the size of eighty hands (*asītihatthappamāṇe padese*) rushed (*ādhāvanti*), sped (*vidhāvanti*), like a bejeweled courtyard (*ratanāveḷa*) scattered with strings of jewels (*ratanadāma*) and powder of jewels (*ratanacuṇṇa*), like a spread cloth (*paṭamiva*) painted with jewels (*ratanacitta*) and gold (*kañcana*), like something sprinkled with the essence of red gold (*rattasuvaṇṇarasanisiñcamānamiva*), like something teeming with a hundred meteors (*ukkāsatanipātasamākulamiva*), like *kaṇikāra* flowers (*kaṇikārapupphamiva*) scattered without interruption (*nirantara*), like powder (*cuṇṇamiva*) of Chinese flour (*cīnapiṭṭha*) thrown (*khitta*) by the force of the wind (*vāyuvega*), and like a forest clearing (*vanaantaraṃ*) shimmering and sparkling with dispersed and scattered rainbows (*indadhanuvijjulatātārāgaṇappabhāvisaravipphuritaviccharitamiva ca*) was (*hoti*).\nAnd furthermore (*ca pana*), the body (*sarīraṃ*) of the Blessed One (*bhagavato*), adorned (*anurañjitañca*) with the eighty minor marks (*asīti anubyañjana*), was like a blossoming lotus (*vikasitakamaluppalamiva*), like a lake (*saraṃ*) full of blooming *sabba* water lilies (*pāliphullamiva*), a *pāricchattakaṃ*, like a sky sparkling with starlight (*tārāmarīcivikasitamiva*), like the surface of the sky (*gaganatalaṃ*) mocking with glory (*siriyā avahasantamiva*), and as for his garland (*mālā*) of thirty-two excellent marks (*dvattiṃsavaralakkhaṇa*), shining with a fathom's extent of light (*byāmappabhāparikkhepavilāsinī*), having been strung together (*ganthetvā*), as if surpassing in glory (*siriṃ siriyā abhibhavantimiva*) the glory of thirty-two moon garlands (*ṭhapitadvattiṃsacandamālāya*), thirty-two sun garlands (*dvattiṃsasūriyamālāya*), [and] thirty-two emperor garlands (*dvattiṃsacakkavattidvattiṃsasakkadevarājadvattiṃsamahābrahmānaṃ*) placed in order (*paṭipāṭiyā ṭhapita*).\nAnd those monks (*bhikkhū*) standing (*ṭhitā*) surrounding (*parivāretvā*) that Blessed One (*tañca pana bhagavantaṃ*) were all (*sabbeva*) of few wishes (*appicchā*), content (*santuṭṭhā*), fond of solitude (*pavivittā*), aloof (*asaṃsaṭṭhā*), exhorters (*codakā*), censors of evil (*pāpagarahino*), teachers (*vattāro*), tolerant of correction (*vacanakkhamā*), endowed with virtue (*sīlasampannā*), concentration (*samādhi*), wisdom (*paññā*), emancipation (*vimutti*), and the knowledge and vision of emancipation (*vimuttiññāṇadassanasampannā*).\nIn their midst (*tesaṃ majjhe*), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), was like a golden pillar (*kañcanathambho*) surrounded (*parikkhitto*) by a red woolen rampart (*rattakambalapākāra*), like a golden boat (*suvaṇṇanāvā*) amidst a cluster of red lotus flowers (*rattapadumasaṇḍamajjhagatā*), like a tower of flame (*aggikkhandho*) encircled by a coral railing (*pavāḷavedikāparikkhitto*), or like the full moon (*puṇṇacando*) surrounded by the host of stars (*tārāgaṇaparivārito*), pleased (*pīṇayati*) the eyes (*cakkhūni*) even of the birds and beasts (*migapakkhīnampi*), much more (*pageva*) then [did he please] the eyes of gods and humans (*devamanussānaṃ*).\nAnd on that day (*tasmiñca pana divase*), for the most part (*yebhuyyena*) eighty great *theras* (*asītimahātherā*) having made (*karitvā*) their cloud-colored (*meghavaṇṇaṃ*) rag robes (*paṃsukūlaṃ*) one-shouldered (*ekaṃsaṃ*), taking (*ādāya*) their walking sticks (*kattaradaṇḍaṃ*), like perfumed elephants (*gandhahatthino*) clad in solid armor (*suvammavammitā viya*), free from corruptions (*vigatadosā*), their corruptions ejected (*vantadosā*), their defilements shattered (*bhinnakilesā*), their tangles disentangled (*vijaṭitajaṭā*), and their bonds cut (*chinnabandhanā*) surrounded (*parivārayiṃsu*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*).\nHe (*so*), himself (*sayam*) without lust (*vītarāgo*) [and] with those without lust (*vītarāgehi*), himself (*sayam*) without hatred (*vītadoso*) [and] with those without hatred (*vītadosehi*), himself (*sayam*) without delusion (*vītamoho*) [and] with those without delusion

Even now (*etarahipi kho*), monks (*bhikkhave*), in the present time (*paccuppannaṃ addhānaṃ*), beings (*sattā*) come together and meet (*saṃsandanti samenti*) according to their elements (*dhātusova*); those with inferior inclinations (*hīnādhimuttikā*)… those with noble inclinations (*kalyāṇādhimuttikā*) come together and meet with those with noble inclinations (*kalyāṇādhimuttikehi saddhiṃ saṃsandanti samentī*).\" Thus, the diverse inclinations (*nānādhimuttikatā*), diverse dispositions (*nānajjhāsayatā*), diverse views (*nānādiṭṭhikatā*), diverse tolerances (*nānākhantitā*), diverse preferences (*nānārucitā*) of beings (*sattānaṃ*), like measuring with a *nāḷī*, like weighing with scales (*tulāya*), are known (*viditā*) by the knowledge of diverse inclinations (*nānādhimuttikatāñāṇena*), by the knowledge of omniscience (*sabbaññutaññāṇena*), that which is well-known (*sā suppaṭividitā*).\nEven two beings (*dvepi sattā*) with the same disposition (*ekajjhāsayā*) are difficult to find in the world (*lokasmiṃ*).\nWhen one wants to go (*ekasmiṃ gantukāme*), the other wants to stay (*eko ṭhātukāmo hoti*); when one wants to drink (*ekasmiṃ pivitukāme*), the other wants to eat (*eko bhuñjitukāmo*).\nAmong these two teachers and students (*dvīsu ācariyantevāsīsu*), this is because \"*Suppiyo the wanderer… closely follows the Blessed One… and the monastic community* (*bhagavantaṃ piṭṭhito piṭṭhito anubandhā honti bhikkhusaṅghañcā*),\"\nThere, \"*itihameti* \" means \"*itiha* \" these (*ime*), thus it means \"these\" (*evaṃ imeti attho*).\nThe rest is as already stated (*sesaṃ vuttanayameva*).",

    "commentary_english": "4. Furthermore, the Exalted One, realizing the monks' discussion—here, \"realizing\" means knowing through his knowledge of omniscience ( *sabbaññutaññāṇa*).\n\nIndeed, the Exalted One knows by seeing with his physical eye in some instances, just as in: \"The Exalted One saw a large log being carried away by the current of the river Ganges,\" etc. (Saṃyutta Nikāya 4.241).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by seeing with his divine eye, just as in: \"The Exalted One saw, with his divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, those deities accepting items in Pāṭaligāma worth a thousand,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 2.152).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by hearing with his ordinary ear, just as in: \"The Exalted One heard Āyasmā Ānanda's conversation with Subhadda the wandering ascetic,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 2.213).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by hearing with his divine ear, just as in: \"The Exalted One heard, with his divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, Sandhāna the householder's conversation with Nigrodha the wandering ascetic,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 3.54).\n\nBut here, he knew by hearing through his knowledge of omniscience.\n\nWhat was he doing when he knew? [He was engaged in] the activity of the last watch of the night. And this activity is of two kinds: beneficial ( *sātthakaṃ*) and useless ( *niratthakaṃ*).\n\nOf these, all tendencies to useless activity were abolished by the Exalted One with his attainment of the path of *arahatship* at the *bodhi* tree itself.\n\nBut from then on, the Exalted One remained engaged only in beneficial activity.\n\nThis is of five kinds: the activity before the meal ( *purebhattakiccaṃ*), the activity after the meal ( *pacchābhattakiccaṃ*), the activity of the first watch of the night ( *purimayāmakiccaṃ*), the activity of the middle watch ( *majjhimayāmakiccaṃ*), and the activity of the last watch ( *pacchimayāmakiccaṃ*).\n\nHere, the activity before the meal is as follows: The Exalted One would rise early in the morning and, out of compassion for his attendant and for the sake of his physical well-being, attend to his morning ablutions, such as washing his face. Then he would remain seated in seclusion until the time for the alms round. When the time for the alms round arrived, he would change his lower robe, fasten the waistband, put on the upper robe, and, taking his bowl, enter the village or town for alms; sometimes he would go alone, sometimes with a retinue of *bhikkhus*; sometimes naturally, sometimes with many miracles occurring.\n\nFor example, when the Lord of the World went for alms, gentle winds would go before him, clearing the ground. Clouds would sprinkle drops of water to still the dust along the path, and then remain as a canopy overhead. Other winds would gather flowers and strew them along the road. The elevated areas of the ground would lower themselves, and the depressed areas would raise themselves, so that the ground was always level beneath the tread of his feet. Sometimes, lotus flowers with a comfortable touch, the size of chariot wheels, would receive his feet.\n\nAs soon as he placed his right foot inside the city gate, six-colored rays would emanate from his body, adorning the mansions, peaked houses and other buildings, making them appear like they were enveloped in golden-hued colors or surrounded by painted cloths, darting here and there. Elephants, horses, birds, and other creatures, while standing in their places, would make sounds in a sweet manner, as well as drums, lutes, and other musical instruments and ornaments worn on the bodies of people.\n\nBy these signs, people would know, \"Today, the Exalted One has entered here for alms.\"\n\nThen, well-dressed and well-groomed, bringing scents, flowers, and other offerings, they would come out of their houses, enter the main street, respectfully honor the Exalted One with scents, flowers, and other offerings, pay homage to him, and ask, \"Venerable Sir, give us ten *bhikkhus*, give us twenty, give us fifty... up to... a hundred,\" and, taking the Exalted One's bowl, prepare a seat and respectfully fill it with alms food.\n\nHaving completed his meal duties, the Exalted One would survey the minds of those beings and teach them the *Dhamma* in such a way that some would become established in the refuges (*saraṇagamanesu*), some in the five precepts (*pañcasu sīlesu*), some in one of the fruits of *sotāpatti* (stream-enterer), *sakadāgāmi* (once-returner), or *anāgāmi* (non-returner); others, having gone forth into homelessness, would reach the highest fruit of *arahatship*.\n\nHaving benefited the multitude in this way, he would rise from his seat and go to the monastery ( *vihāraṃ*).\n\nThere, having gone to the pavilion ( *maṇḍalamāḷe*), he would sit down on the excellent Buddha seat that had been arranged, waiting for the *bhikkhus* to finish their meal duties.\n\nThen, when the *bhikkhus* had finished their meal duties, the attendant would inform the Exalted One.\n\nThen the Exalted One would enter the Perfumed Chamber ( *gandhakuṭiṃ*).\n\nThis, first of all, is the activity before the meal.\n\nThen, after having completed the pre-meal duties in this way, the Exalted One would sit in the antechamber of the Perfumed Chamber, wash his feet, and, standing on the footstool, would exhort the *bhikkhu* *saṅgha*, \" *Bhikkhus*, strive with diligence! Rare is the appearance of a Buddha in the world, rare is the obtaining of human existence, rare is prosperity, rare is the going forth, rare is the hearing of the true *Dhamma*.\"\n\nThere, some would ask the Exalted One for a meditation subject (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ*).\n\nThe Exalted One would then give them a meditation subject suitable to their disposition (*cariyānurūpaṃ*).\n\nThen all of them, having paid homage to the Exalted One, would go to their respective places for the night or for the day.\n\nSome would go to the forest (*araññaṃ*), some to the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūlaṃ*), some to one of the mountains, etc., some to the heaven of the Four Great Kings (*cātumahārājikabhavanaṃ*)...pe...some to the heaven of those with power over others' creations ( *vasavattibhavanaṃ*).\n\nThen the Exalted One, having entered the Perfumed Chamber, if he wished, would lie down for a moment on his right side in the lion's posture (*sīhaseyyaṃ*), mindful and fully aware.\nThen, with his body refreshed, he would rise and in the second portion would look at the world.\n\nIn the third part of the afternoon, the people of the village or town near which he was dwelling, who had given alms in the morning, would assemble in the monastery, well-dressed and well-groomed, bringing scents, flowers, and other offerings.\n\nThe Exalted One would approach, displaying whatever wonders were appropriate for the assembly present. Then, sitting down in his special seat in the assembly hall, he would teach the *Dhamma* in a way fitting the time and occasion. When the discourse was finished, he would dismiss the assembly, and the people, having done homage to him, would depart.\n\nThese were his afternoon activities.\n\nWhen he had finished his afternoon activities, if he wanted to bathe, he would rise up from his seat, enter the bathroom, and refresh his body with water brought by his attendant.\n\nThe attendant would also take the seat and prepare it in a cell in the Fragrant Collage.\n\nThe Exalted One, having put on a fresh well-dyed lower robe, fastened the waistband and arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, would return to his cell and sit alone for a few moments in solitary meditation. Thereafter the *bhikkhus* would arrive from various directions to attend upon the Master.\n\nSome would ask questions, some would request meditation subjects, some would ask about points of *Dhamma*.\n\nThe Exalted One would pass the first watch of the night complying with their requests.\n\nThese were his activities during the first watch of the night.\n\nWhen the first watch activities were completed and the *bhikkhus* had paid homage to the Master and departed, the deities of the entire ten-thousandfold world system would gain the opportunity to see the Exalted One. Having approached him, they would ask whatever questions might occur to them, even one only four syllables in length.\n\nAnswering the questions of those divine-beings, the Blessed One would spend the middle watch of the night.\n\nThese were his activities during the middle watch of the night.\n\nHe divided the last watch of the night into three parts. Because his body ached from silting continuously since early morning, he would spend one part pacing up and down to dispel the discomfort.\n\nIn the second part, he would enter the Fragrant Cottage and lie down on his right side, in the lion posture, mindful and clearly comprehending.\n\nIn the third part, he would rise, take a seat, and survey the world with the Buddha-eye in order to discover individuals who had observed their course of duties, such as giving alms and observing precepts, in the presence of the Buddhas of the past.\n\nThese were his activities during the last watch of the night.\n\nOn that day the Exalted One, after concluding his morning activities in *Rājagaha*, set out on his journey in the afternoon. In the first watch of the night he explained meditation subjects to the *bhikkhus*, and in the middle watch answered the questions of the deities. In the last watch, while pacing up and down on the walkway, he learned of the discussion taking place among the *bhikkhus* concerning his knowledge of omniscience, having heard it with his knowledge of omniscience itself.\n\nHence it was said – “he understood while doing the activities of the last watch of the night.”\n\nRealizing this, he thought: “These *bhikkhus* are holding a discussion concerning my knowledge of omniscience. The working of the knowledge of omniscience is not clear to them; it is clear only to me.\n\nBut when I have gone there, they will immediately tell me all about their discussion. Then, making their discussion the occasion for a discourse, as though lifting up Mount *Sineru* or pounding the sky with a golden mallet, I will teach the *Brahmajāla Sutta*. Within it I will analyze the three classes of virtue, roar my irreversible lion’s roar over the sixty-two cases of views, subsume the views under the law of conditionality, and having elucidated the Buddha-qualities, I will bring the teaching\n\nHaving thought thus, he approached the *maṇḍalamāḷa*.\n\nThat is, he should be approached by whatever part of the direction.\n\nOr, this is an instrumental word in the sense of location, that is, the meaning here is that he went to the place where that *maṇḍalamāḷa* was.\n\n\"Sit on the prepared seat\" - It is said that in the time of the Buddha, wherever even one *bhikkhu* was dwelling, everywhere a Buddha-seat was always prepared.\n\nWhy? The Exalted One, having taken a meditation subject from his own presence, while dwelling in a convenient place, directs his mind, thinking: “such and such a one has taken a meditation subject from my presence and gone away, will he be able to produce a distinction or not?”\n\nThen he sees him, having dismissed the meditation subject, reflecting upon an unwholesome thought. Then, “How is this? After this clansman has received a subject of meditation from a Master such as myself, should unwholesome thoughts overwhelm him and drive him on through the suffering of the beginningless round of existence?” In order to help him, the Exalted One would show himself to the *bhikkhu*, admonish him, and rising into the air, return to his own dwelling place.\n\nThen those *bhikkhus* who had been admonished would reflect: “The Master, knowing our minds, came here and showed himself, standing in our presence.\"\n\nAt that moment - \"Venerable Sir, sit here, sit here\" - the search for a seat is called a burden.\n\nTherefore, they would dwell having prepared a seat.\n\nHe who has a chair prepares it.\n\nHe who has none prepares a bed, or a bench, or a log, or a rock, or a heap of sand.\n\nNot obtaining that, they would also gather old leaves, and spread a discarded cloth over them, and set them in place.\n\nHere, however, there was only the king's sitting seat; having dusted it by beating, and prepared it, and surrounded it, those *bhikkhus*, praising the excellence of the Exalted One's knowledge of the dispositions, sat down.\n\nWith reference to that, it was said - “Sit on the prepared seat.”\n\nHaving thus sat down, however, knowing, for the purpose of raising up a discussion, he asked the *bhikkhus*:\n\nAnd they told him everything.\n\nTherefore it was said - \"Having sat down, indeed, the Exalted One\" - and so on.\n\nThere, what is the meaning: to what sort of talk are you sitting together?\n\n\"To what is there no body?\" is also a *pāḷi*, the meaning of that is: to what are you here? \"To what is there no body?\" is also a *pāḷi*.\nAnd its meaning is just like the previous one.\n\n*Antarākathā* means another, single conversation between instances of *kammaṭṭhāna*, attention, instruction, questioning, and so on.\n\n*Vippakatā* means unfinished, not having reached its peak, due to my arrival.\n\nWhat does that show? \"I have not come to interrupt your conversation, but I have come, through my omniscience, to bring your conversation to a conclusion, to bring it to the peak, and show it to you.\" Thus, seated, he institutes the invitation to the all-knowing.\n\nHere too, the meaning is: \"This, venerable sir, was our interrupted conversation when the Blessed One arrived.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, this interrupted *guṇa* talk of ours concerned the Blessed One's knowledge of omniscience, and was not worldly talk or base talk. The Blessed One has arrived; please bring it to a conclusion and teach it to us now.\"\n\nAnd thus far, the introductory narrative spoken by the venerable Ānanda, concerning the lotus and blue water-lily pond, the pleasant descent, the jeweled staircase adorned with the beauty of the construction of a spotless stone surface, the expanse of ground resembling a scattered pearl surface strewn with sand, the bathing place as it were, surrounded by a well-divided wall and variegated platform, the desire to touch the path of the stars as it were, the pleasant ascent to the excellent palace of towering height, the staircase adorned with the shining beauty of the emergence of a mass of jewels bound by golden vines of smooth, soft ivory planks as it were, the sound mixed with the sounds of the striking of golden bracelets, anklets, and so on, the great house adorned with the magnificence of abundant wealth frequented by the household with sweet voices of speech and laughter, the great door with its well-established and wide doorposts shining with the abundance of the luster of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, coral, and so on for the pleasant entrance as it were, the basis adorned with time, place, region, topic, assembly, and occasion for the pleasant comprehension of this *sūtra* possessed of meaning and expression, indicative of the Buddha's power of virtue, has been spoken, the commentary on its meaning is complete.",

    "commentary_english": "5. Now, with the words “If, *bhikkhus*, others speak in dispraise of me,” and so on, the time has come to comment on the *sutta* delivered by the Exalted One.\n\nAnd that *sutta*-commentary [follows].\n\nAnd since this commentary will be clearer if we first examine the grounds on which the Exalted One delivers a *sutta*, we will deal with this latter point first.\n\nThere are four grounds for the delivery of a *sutta*: personal inclination (*attajjhāsaya*), the inclinations of others (*parajjhāsaya*), the proposal of a question (*pucchāvasika*) and the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattika*).\n\nAmong these, those *suttas* that the Exalted One declares entirely through his own inclination, without being requested by others, have personal inclination as the ground for their delivery. Some examples of this class are: the *Ākaṅkheyya Sutta*, the *Vattha Sutta*, the *Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta*, the *Mahāsaḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta*, the *Ariyavaṃsa Sutta*, and many *suttas* on the right endeavors (*sammappadhāna*), the bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*), the faculties (*indriya*), powers (*bala*), factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*), and factors of the path (*maggaṅga*). Their ground is personal inclination (*attajjhāsayo nikkhepo*).\n\nThose *suttas* that he declares by reason of the inclinations of others, after discerning their inclination, acquiescence, state of mind (*manas*), aspiration (*abhinīhāra*), and capacity for understanding (*bujjhana-bhāva*), have the inclinations of others as the ground for their delivery. An instance is the case of Rāhula: when the Exalted One perceived that the factors maturing in emancipation (*vimutti*) had reached maturity in Rāhula, he thought: “Let me now lead Rāhula to the destruction of the cankers (*āsava*).\" Some *suttas* of this class are: the *Cūḷarāhulovāda Sutta*, the *Mahārāhulovāda Sutta*, the *Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta*, the *Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta*; their ground is the inclinations of others (*parajjhāsayo nikkhepo*).\n\nWhen the four assemblies (*parisā*), the four classes (*vaṇṇā*), *nāgas*, *supaṇṇas*, *gandhabbas*, *asuras*, *yakkhas*, the Great Kings (*mahārājāno*), the gods (*devā*) of the Heaven of the Thirty-three (*tāvatiṃsa*), and *Mahābrahmās* approach the Exalted One and ask questions— about the factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*)— they say, “*Bojjhaṅga*, *bojjhaṅga*, venerable sir (*bhante*)”.\n\n“Hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*), hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*)” they say, venerable sir (*bhante*). “Are these, venerable sir (*bhante*), the five aggregates of clinging (*pañcupādānakkhandhā*)?”\n\nThe \"best treasure of man,\" and so on, asks the question.\n\nTo this class belong numerous *suttas* of the *Bojjhaṅga-saṃyutta* and other suttas, and the *Devatā-saṃyutta*, *Māra-saṃyutta*, *Brahma-saṃyutta*, *Sakkapañha*, *Cūḷavedalla*, *Mahāvedalla*, *Sāmaññaphala*, *Āḷavaka*, *Sūciloma*, *Kharaloma Suttas*, etc.; their ground is the proposal of a question (*pucchāvasiko nikkhepo*).\n\nAnd those *suttas* declared because a special incident had occurred—examples are the *suttas Dhammadāyāda*, *Cūḷasīhanāda*, the *Candūpama*, *Puttamaṃsūpama*, *Dārukkhandhūpama*, *Aggikkhandūpama*, *Pheṇapiṇḍūpama*, and *Pāricchattakūpama*; these have the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiko*) as the ground for their pronouncement (*nikkhepo*).\n\nOf these four grounds (*nikkhepa*), this *sutta* has the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiko nikkhepo*) as the ground for its delivery.\n\nSince it was delivered by the Exalted One on account of the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiyā*).\n\nAnd what was that incident (*aṭṭhuppattiyā*)? Praise and dispraise (*vaṇṇāvaṇṇe*).\n\nThe teacher spoke in dispraise (*avaṇṇa*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattaya*), the pupil in praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*).\n\nThus, making praise and dispraise the occasion, the Exalted One, skilled in teaching, began the discourse with the words “If, *bhikkhus*, others speak in dispraise of me.”\n\nThere \"mine,\" that is a word expressing ownership, the meaning is \"mine.\"\n\nThe letter ‘va’ (*vā*) has the sense of *vikappana*.\n\nOthers means beings who are opposed.\n\nThere means among those who speak dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nAlthough there was no resentment (*āghāta*) in those *bhikkhus*, the Buddha set up a guideline (*dhamma-netti*) in order to prohibit clansmen in the future from arousing unwholesome states of mind (*akusala-uppatti*) under similar circumstances.\n\nThere, \"it strikes the mind,\" is resentment (*āghāta*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for anger (*kopa*).\n\n\"They are displeased (*appatītā*), therefore unsatisfied (*atuṭṭhā*), unhappy (*asomanassikā*),\" is discontent (*appaccaya*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for sadness (*domanassa*).\n\n\"He does not delight in what is beneficial (*hita*) for himself or others\" is delightlessness (*anabhiraddhi*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for anger (*kopa*).\n\nThus here, with two terms, the aggregate of volitional formations (*saṅkhārakkhandha*), and with one term, the aggregate of feeling (*vedanākkhandha*)—thus two aggregates (*khandhā*) are spoken of.\n\nBy reason of them, the cause (*kāraṇa*) of the remaining associated states (*sampayuttadhammā*) is refuted.\n\nHaving thus, by the first statement, warded off mental displeasure (*mano-padosa*), by the second statement, showing the danger (*ādīnava*) there, he said, “If you were to become angry (*kupitā*) or upset (*anattamanā*), you would only be creating an obstacle (*antarāya*) for yourselves.\"\n\nThere, “If you were to become angry” means, among those who speak dispraise (*avaṇṇabhāsakesu*), or in that dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), if you were to be; the meaning is, if you were to be.\n\n\"Angry\" (*kupitā*) means with anger (*kopa*), \"upset\" (*anattamanā*) with sadness (*domanassa*).\n\n\"'You would only be creating an obstacle (*antarāya*) for yourselves'\" means, for you, with that anger (*kopa*), and with that being upset (*anattamanatāya*), there would be an obstacle (*antarāyo*) to the first *jhāna* and so on.\n\nHaving thus, by the second statement, shown the danger (*ādīnavaṃ*), by the third statement, showing inability (*asamatthataṃ*), even in merely recognizing the meaning of what is said (*vacanatthasallakkhaṇa*), he said, “Would you be able (*api nu tumhe*)…?” and so on.\n\nThere, \"of others\" (*paresanti*) means of anyone at all (*yesaṃ kesaṃ ci*).\n\nFor an angry person knows neither the meaning (*atthaṃ*) of what is well-spoken (*subhāsita*) nor of what is ill-spoken (*dubbhāsita*) to Buddhas, Private Buddhas (*paccekabuddha*), noble disciples (*ariyasāvaka*), mothers, fathers, or opponents (*paccatthika*).\n\nAs he said: Thus, in all ways, having prohibited mental displeasure (*manopadosaṃ*) with regard to dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), now, showing the way in which to proceed (*paṭipajjitabbākāraṃ*), he said: “There, by you, what is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*) as untrue (*abhūtato*)…” and so on.\n\nThere, there, \"by you\" means, in that dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), by you.\n\nWhat is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*) should be refuted as untrue (*abhūtato*) means, what is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*), that should be removed (*apanetabbaṃ*) as untrue (*abhūtabhāvena*).\nHow [is this done]? By the method beginning with \" *iti petaṃ abhūtaṃ* \" and so forth.\n\nHere is the interpretation: \"If you should hear others say: ‘Your teacher is not omniscient *sabbaññū*, the *dharma* is badly expounded, the *saṃgha* is practicing wrongly,’\" and so forth, you should not remain silent.\n\nYou should reply: \"What you say is false. For this reason it is false; for this reason, it is untrue. There is no such thing in us; this is not found among us. Our teacher is omniscient, the *dharma* is well expounded, the *saṃgha* is practicing the good path. Such and such is the reason.\"\n\nHere, it should be understood that the second phrase is a synonym of the first, and the fourth is a synonym of the third.\n\nThis unraveling should be undertaken only in the case of dispraise (*avaṇṇa*), not in all cases.\n\nFor if someone were to say, \"You are depraved (*dussīlo*), your teacher is depraved, you did this and that, your teacher did [this and that],\" and you should remain silent and hear it patiently, you should be cautious.\n\nTherefore, putting away ill will (*manopadosaṃ akatvā*), you may unravel the dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nBut if anyone should abuse you with any of the ten forms of abuse—calling you a buffalo (*oṭṭho*), an ox (*goṇo*), etc.—you should look upon him with equanimity (*ajjhupekkhitvā*) and practice forbearance and patience (*adhivāsanakhanti*).",

    "commentary_english": "6. Thus, having shown the characteristics in the realm of dispraise, now, in order to show it in the realm of praise, he says, \"Whether others might speak in praise of me, *bhikkhus*,\" and so on.\n\nThere, \"others\" means whatever gods and humans are serene.\n\nIt is called *ānanda* because one rejoices with it; this is a designation for rapture (*pīti*).\n\nThe state of being of good mind is gladness (*somanassa*); this is a designation for mental pleasure (*cetasikasukha*).\n\nThe state of being exhilarated is exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*).\n\nWhose is exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*)? It belongs to the mind (*cetasoti*).\n\nThis is a designation for the rapture of exultation (*uppilāpanapīti*) that brings elation (*uddhaccāvahāya*).\n\nHere also, with two words, the aggregate of formations (*saṅkhārakkhandha*) is spoken of, and with one, the aggregate of feeling (*vedanākkhandha*) is spoken of.\n\nThus, by the first method, having warded off exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*), by the second, showing the danger (*ādīnava*) in that, he says, \"If you were to become jubilant there,\" and so on.\n\nHere also, \"you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves (*tumhaṃ yevassa tena antarāyo*),\" meaning that, through that exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*), an obstacle (*antarāyo*) would arise for you to the first *jhāna*, etc.; this is the meaning to be understood.\n\nWhy was this said? Didn't the Blessed One describe only rapture and gladness (*pītisomanassa*) in the jewels in many hundreds of *suttas*, beginning with, \"Those *bhikkhus* who are serene in the Buddha, are serene in the highest,\" and so on?\n\nIt is true, it was described, but that is dependent on renunciation (*nekkhamma*).\n\nHere, the intention is the rapture and joy (*pītisomanassa*) connected with worldliness, the kind that arises by thinking in this way: \"Our Buddha, our Dhamma,\" and so on, like that which arose for venerable Channa (*āyasmato channassa*).\n\nFor that is what creates an obstacle to attaining the first *jhāna*, etc. (*jhānādipaṭilābhāya antarāyakaraṃ hoti*).\n\nFor that reason, even the venerable Channa (*āyasmā channo*), until the Buddha passed away into final *nirvāṇa*, was not able to produce distinction, but at the time of final *nirvāṇa*, having been threatened by the *brahmadaṇḍa* declared by him, having abandoned that rapture and gladness (*pītisomanassa*), he produced distinction.\n\nTherefore, it should be understood that this was said having in mind only that which creates an obstacle (*antarāyakaraṃ*).\n\nThis rapture (*pīti*) is associated with greed (*lobhasahagatā*).\n\nAnd greed (*lobho*) is similar to anger (*kodha*).\n\nAs he said, \"However, a third statement, though not come here, should be understood as implicit.\"\n\nFor the greedy man, like the angry man, does not understand the meaning of what is spoken.\n\nThis is the interpretation of the section showing the proper course of practice: \"If you should hear others say: 'Your teacher is omniscient (*sabbaññū*), a Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), the Dhamma is well expounded (*svākkhāto*); the Saṅgha is practicing the good path (*suppaṭipanno*),' you should not remain silent.\"\n\nYou should acknowledge it thus: \"What you say is a fact. For this reason it is a fact; for this reason it is true.\"\n\nThe Exalted One, for such and such a reason, is a Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*); the Dhamma, for such and such a reason, is well expounded (*svākkhāto*), visible here and now (*sandiṭṭhiko*); the Saṅgha, for such and such a reason, is practicing the good path (*suppaṭipanno*), practicing the straight path (*ujuppaṭipanno*).\"\n\nIf asked: 'Are you virtuous (*sīlavā*)?', you may claim: 'I am virtuous (*sīlavāhamasmī*).'\n\nIf asked: ‘Have you gained the first *jhāna*? ...’ etc., or ‘Are you an *arhat*?', then you may admit the fact, but only to fellow *bhikkhus* (*sabhāgānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ*).\n\nIn this way domination by evil desires is avoided, and the fruitfulness of the Dispensation (*sāsana*) of the Buddha is made plain.\n\nThe rest should be understood in the way already described (*vuttanayeneva*).",

    "commentary_english": "7. \"Appamattakaṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhaveti\": What is the connection? This *sutta* is bound by two terms: praise (*vaṇṇa*) and dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nThere, dispraise is refuted by pointing out: “For such and such a reason this is false (*abhūtaṃ*), this is untrue (*ataccha*).” etc., just as fire is extinguished by submerging it in water.\n\nAnd praise is confirmed by acknowledging fact as fact thus: “For such and such a reason this is a fact (*bhūtaṃ*).”\n\nPraise is of two kinds: that spoken by Brahmadatta and that spoken by the company of *bhikkhus* beginning with \"Wonderful, friend!\" (*acchariyaṃ āvuso*), etc.\n\nAmong them, the Master will show the sequel to the praise spoken by the company of *bhikkhus* later in the *sutta*, in the section on the elucidation of emptiness (*suññatā*).\n\nHere he begins the teaching by showing the sequel to the praise spoken by Brahmadatta: “*Appamattakaṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhave*.”\n\nThere, \"*appamattaka*\" is a name for insignificance (*paritta*).\n\n\"*Oramattaka*\" is a synonym of that.\n\n\"*Mattā*\" means measure (*pamāṇaṃ*).\n\n\"*Appaṃ mattā etassa*\" means insignificant (*appamattakaṃ*).\n\n\"*Oraṃ mattā etassa*\" means inferior (*oramattakaṃ*).\n\nVirtue (*sīla*) itself is just virtue (*sīlamattakaṃ*).\n\nThis is what is meant: ‘*Appamattakaṃ kho, panetaṃ bhikkhave, oramattakaṃ sīlamattakaṃ*’ means that a worldling might speak even after making an effort, saying “I will speak praise of the *Tathāgata*.”\n\nHere it might be asked: Surely virtue (*sīla*) is the supreme adornment (*aggavibhūsanaṃ*) of a *yogin*? As the ancients have said: And the Exalted One himself has extolled virtue in many hundreds of *suttas*.\n\nFor example: “If, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu* should wish: ‘May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the holy life (*sabrahmacārī*), revered and esteemed,’ he should be perfect in fulfilling the rules of conduct (*sīla*)” etc. (Ma. Ni. 1. 65).\n\n“As, *bhikkhus*, whatever seed groups (*bījagāma*) and vegetable groups (*bhūtagāma*) come to growth (*vuḍḍhiṃ*), increase (*virūḷhiṃ*) and maturity (*vepullaṃ*), all do so by being dependent on the earth (*pathavī*); so these seed groups and vegetable groups come to growth, increase and maturity.\n\nEven so, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu*, by relying on virtue (*sīla*), by being established in virtue, developing the seven factors of enlightenment (*sattabojjhaṅga*), cultivating the seven factors of enlightenment, comes to growth, increase and maturity in the Dhamma” (Saṃ. Ni. 5. 150).\n\nThus also other many *suttas* should be seen.\n\nAnd so too in many other *suttas* virtue is extolled.\n\nThen why does he say “insignificant (*appamattaka*)” in this instance? He does so by placing the superior qualities above.\n\nFor virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration (*samādhi*) and concentration does not reach the level of the excellence of wisdom (*paññā*). Therefore, in comparison with the higher qualities, the inferior ones are called “insignificant (*oramattakaṃ*).”\n\nHow is it that virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration? The Exalted One, after he was fully enlightened, in the seventh year, at the city gate of Sāvatthī, at the foot of the Kaṇḍamba tree, in a jewelled pavilion twelve *yojanas* wide, while sitting on a jewelled divan one *yojana* wide, under a divine white parasol three *yojanas* wide, before an assembly of people extending for twelve *yojanas* in all directions, showing his acceptance of the challenge posed by the sectarians and quelling their forces, performed the twin miracle: “From the upper part of his body a mass of fire issued forth, and from the lower part a stream of water… from each hair-pore a mass of fire issued forth, and from each hair-pore a stream of water, of six colors,” and so on.\n\nFrom his body of golden color, rays of golden color issued forth, continuing on to the summit of existence (*bhavagga*), as if it were a time of adorning the entire ten-thousandfold world sphere. The remaining colored rays, issuing from his body in turn according to color, came forth so that they appeared to come forth simultaneously, at a single moment.\n\nAnd there is no occurrence of two acts of consciousness (*citta*) at a single moment.\n\nBut in the case of the Buddhas, by reason of the brevity of their stay in the *bhavaṅga* and through their fivefold mastery, the differently colored rays appeared to come forth at a single moment.\n\nBut in reality the adverting, preparation, and resolution for each colored ray is done separately.\n\nThe Exalted One attains the blue *kasiṇa* absorption in order to produce the blue rays, the yellow *kasiṇa* in order to produce the yellow rays, the red and white *kasiṇas* in order to produce the red and white rays, the fire *kasiṇa* in order to produce the mass of fire, and the water *kasiṇa* in order to produce the stream of water.\n\nThe Master paces up and down, while projected images of himself stand or sit or lie down and so on; all may he explained at length.\n\nIn all this, there is not even one thing that was accomplished by virtue. All was accomplished by concentration.\n\nThus virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration.\n\nMoreover, what the Exalted One, after fulfilling the perfections (*pārami*) for four incalculable periods of a hundred thousand *kappas*, at the age of twenty-nine, departing from the palace that was the glorious abode of a wheel-turning monarch (*cakkavatti*), going forth on the bank of the Anoma River, practicing striving (*padhānayoga*) for six years, on the Visakha full-moon day, after partaking of milk-rice (*madhupāyāsa*) mixed with divine nourishment that had been offered by Sujātā in the village of Uruvela, in the evening, entering the *bodhi-maṇḍa* from the south-east, circumambulating the king of *assattha* trees three times, standing on the north-eastern side, after spreading out a grass mat, after crossing his legs in the three-jointed lotus posture, having made goodwill (*mettā*) the foremost object of his attention, resolving on effort (*vīriya*), having made the trunk of the *bodhi* tree fifty *hatthas* high stand behind him like a silver column placed on a golden seat on a divan fourteen *hatthas* high, being sheltered above by the branch of the *bodhi* tree like a jeweled parasol, while the golden robes and the coral-like shoots of the *bodhi* tree fell down, as the sun was setting, dispelling the forces of Māra, in the first watch of the night recollecting his former abodes (*pubbenivāsa*), in the middle watch purifying the divine eye (*dibbacakkhu*), at dawn reflecting on the causal relations in the way that is habitual for all Buddhas, after developing the fourth *jhāna* based on mindfulness of breathing, after using that as his footing, after increasing insight (*vipassanā*), by means of the fourth path attained through the order of the paths, destroying all defilements (*kilesa*) and realizing all the qualities of a Buddha – this was his function of wisdom (*paññā*).\n\nThus concentration does not reach to the excellence of wisdom.\n\nThere, just as the water in the hand does not reach the water in a bowl, the water in a bowl does not reach the water in a jar, the water in a jar does not reach the water in a trough, the water in a trough does not reach the water in a pot, the water in a pot does not reach the water in a large pot, the water in a large pot does not reach the water in a cistern, the water in a cistern does not reach the water in a hollow, the water in a hollow does not reach the water in a small stream, the water in a small stream does not reach the water in the five great rivers, the water in the five great rivers does not reach the water in the great sea surrounding the *cakkavāḷa*, the water in the great sea surrounding the *cakkavāḷa* does not reach the water in the great sea at the foot of Mount Sineru.\nHaving placed water in a bowl, a small amount of water in the hand…and so on… having placed water in the ocean at the foot of Mount Meru, a small amount of water in the great *cakravāḷa* ocean.\n\nThus, taking much water from above, the water below becomes little.\n\nJust so, taking each higher quality above, virtue ( *sīla*) below should be understood as \"trifling\" and \"insignificant.\"\n\nTherefore, he said: \"Indeed, monks, this trifling, insignificant, mere virtue.\"\n\nRegarding \"by whom [is known] the worldling (*puthujjana*)\": Here, there, whoever does not have acquisition, questioning, hearing, retention, and reflection on the aggregates (*khandha*), elements (*dhātu*), sense-bases (*āyatana*), etc., this one is a blind worldling (*andha-puthujjana*).\n\nWhoever has those things, he is a virtuous worldling (*kalyāṇa-puthujjana*).\n\nThis one is twofold – he is a worldling (*puthujjana*) because of causes such as the generation, etc., of many kinds of defilements (*kilesa*), etc.\n\nAs he said: \"They generate a multitude of defilements, hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They have not destroyed the multiple forms of personality view (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They look up to a multitude of teachers (*satthar*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They have not emerged from the multitude of destinations, hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They form multiple kamma-formations (*abhisaṅkhāra*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are swept away by a multitude of floods (*ogha*), afflicted by a multitude of afflictions (*santāpa*), consumed by a multitude of fevers (*pariḷāha*)—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are lustful and greedy for the five strands of sense pleasure (*kāmaguṇa*): attached, desiring, tied, infatuated, deep-seated, clinging, attached, bound up—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are covered, closed, enveloped, hidden, concealed, rejected by the five hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*)—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*).\"\n\nOne who is included among the multitude of people who live according to an inferior doctrine (*nīcadhammasamācāra*) and are averse to the doctrine of the *ariyas* ( *ariya-dhamma*), is called a worldling (*puthujjana*). And a person distinct or remote from the *ariyas* endowed with such qualities as virtue (*sīla*), learning (*suta*), etc., is called a worldling (*puthujjana*).\n\nThe Exalted One is called the *Tathāgata* for eight reasons.\n\nThe *Tathāgata* is so called because he has \"thus come\" (*tathā āgata*), because he has \"thus gone\" (*tathā gata*), because he has come to the real characteristic (*tathā-lakkhaṇaṃ āgata*), because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality (*tathā-dhamme yāthāvato abhisambuddha*), because he is a seer of the real (*tathā-dassitāya*), because he is a speaker of the real (*tathā-vāditāya*), because he acts in accordance with his teaching (*tathā-kāritāya*), and in the sense of surpassing (*abhibhavanaṭṭhena*).\n\nWhy is the Exalted One called the *Tathāgata* because he has \"thus come\"? Because the previous fully awakened Buddhas (*sammāsambuddha*) came, engaged in exertion for the welfare of the whole world (*sabba-loka-hitāya*), came—that is, as the Exalted Vipassī, the Exalted Sikhī, the Exalted Vessabhū, the Exalted Kakusandha, the Exalted Koṇāgamana, and the Exalted Kassapa .\n\nWhat does this mean? Our Exalted One has come through the very same aspiration (*abhinīhāra*) that these Exalted Ones came through.\n\nOr just as the Exalted Vipassī…pe… the Exalted Kassapa came after they had fulfilled the perfection of giving (*dāna-pāramī*) after fulfilling the perfections (*pāramī*) of virtue (*sīla*), renunciation (*nekkhamma*), wisdom (*paññā*), energy (*vīriya*), patience (*khanti*), truthfulness (*sacca*), determination (*adhiṭṭhāna*), loving kindness (*mettā*), and equanimity (*upekkhā*), came after they had fulfilled these ten perfections (*dasa pāramiyo*), ten intermediate perfections (*dasa upapāramiyo*), and ten ultimate perfections (*dasa paramatthapāramiyo*), making the full thirty perfections (*samatiṃsa pāramiyo*); made the five great relinquishments (*pañca mahāpariccāge*)—i.e., the relinquishing of limbs (*aṅga-pariccāga*), eyes (*nayana*), wealth (*dhana*), kingdom (*rajja*), and children and wife (*putta-dāra-pariccāga*); fulfilled the preliminary effort (*pubba-yoga*), the preliminary conduct (*pubba-cariya*), the preaching of the *Dhamma* (*dhamma-akkhāna*), conduct conducive to understanding, etc.; attained the limit of the practice of wisdom (*buddhi-cariyāya koṭiṃ patvā āgato*); just so has our Exalted One come.\n\nOr else, just as the Exalted Vipassī … Kassapa came by developing and cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhāna*), the four right endeavors (*sammappadhāna*), the four bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*), the five faculties (*indriya*), the five powers (*bala*), the seven factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*), and the Noble Eightfold Path (*ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ*)—exactly thus has our Exalted One come.\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus come.”\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus come.”\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he has \"thus gone\"? Because as soon as he was born, the Exalted Vipassī went…pe… Kassapa went as soon as they were born.\n\nAnd how did that Exalted One go? As soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground, and then, facing north, went forward with a stride of seven steps.\n\nAs it is said: \"As soon as the *bodhisattva* was born, Ānanda, he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground; then, while a white parasol was held over him, facing north, he went forward with a stride of seven steps. Having surveyed all the directions, he then uttered the roar of the Leader of the Herd: 'I am the foremost in the world. I am pre-eminent in the world. I am supreme in the world. This is my last birth. There is now no renewal of existence.'\" (Dī.\n\nNi.\n\n2.\n31).\n\nAnd his way of going was real? Not unreal, for it was a foretoken of the achievements of distinction.\n\nWhen he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground,\n\nthat was the foretoken of his obtaining the four bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*).\n\nWhen he walked facing north (*uttarābhimukhabhāvo*), that was the foretoken of his supremacy in all the world.\n\nHis stride of seven steps foretokened his obtaining the gems of the seven factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*).\n\nThe golden-staffed chowries that appeared foretokened his defeat of all the sectarian teachers (*titthiya*).\n\nThe white parasol foretokened his obtaining the stainless white parasol of the supreme deliverance of arahatship.\n\nWhen he stood surveying all the directions after completing the seventh step, that foretokened his obtaining the unobstructed knowledge of omniscience.\n\nAnd his uttering the roar of the Leader of the Herd was the foretoken of his setting in motion the supreme, irreversible Wheel of the *Dhamma*.\n\nJust as the previous Exalted Ones went thus, exactly thus did the present Exalted One go. And his way of going was real, not unreal, for it foretokened the above achievements of spiritual distinction.\n\nTherefore, the ancients said: Thus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus gone.”\n\nOr alternatively, as the Exalted Vipassī … the Exalted Kassapa went, exactly thus did the present Exalted One go. That is, abandoning sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*) by renunciation (*nekkhamma*), ill will (*byāpāda*) by benevolence (*abyāpāda*), sloth-and-torpor (*thinamiddha*) by the perception of light (*āloka-saññā*), restlessness-and-remorse (*uddhacca-kukkuccaṃ*) by non-distraction (*avikkhepena*), and perplexity (*vicikicchaṃ*) by the defining of dhammas (*dhamma-vavatthānena*); shattering ignorance (*avijjā*) with knowledge (*ñāṇena*), dispelling discontent (*aratiṃ*) with joy (*pāmojjena*); knocking away the panel of the hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*) with the first jhāna (*paṭhamajjhānena*), making applied and sustained thought (*vitakka-vicāraṃ*) subside with the second jhāna (*dutiyajjhānena*), detaching from joy (*pītiṃ virājetvā*) with the third jhāna (*tatiyajjhānena*), abandoning pleasure and pain (*sukha-dukkhaṃ pahāya*) with the fourth jhāna (*catutthajjhānena*), and transcending the perception of form (*rūpa-saññā*), the perception of resistance (*paṭigha-saññā*), and the perception of diversity (*nānattasaññāyo*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of infinite space (*ākāsānañcāyatanasamāpattiyā*), transcending the perception of the sphere of infinite space (*ākāsānañcāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā*), transcending the perception of the sphere of infinite consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā*), and transcending the perception of the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception (*nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā*) went.\n\nBy insight into impermanence (*aniccānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of permanence (*niccasaññaṃ*), by insight into suffering (*dukkhānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of pleasure (*sukhasaññaṃ*), by insight into non-self (*anattānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of self (*attasaññaṃ*), by insight into aversion (*nibbidānupassanā*) abandoning delight (*nandiṃ*), by insight into dispassion (*virāgānupassanā*) abandoning passion (*rāgaṃ*), by insight into cessation (*nirodhānupassanā*) abandoning origination (*samudayaṃ*), by insight into relinquishment (*paṭinissaggānupassanā*) abandoning grasping (*ādānaṃ*), by insight into dissolution (*khayānupassanā*) abandoning solid perception (*ghanasaññaṃ*), by insight into decline (*vayānupassanā*) abandoning accumulation (*āyūhanaṃ*), by insight into change (*vipariṇāmānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of stability (*dhuvasaññaṃ*), by insight into the signless (*animittānupassanā*) abandoning the sign (*nimittaṃ*), by insight into the desireless (*appaṇihitānupassanā*) abandoning desire (*paṇidhiṃ*), by insight into emptiness (*suññatānupassanā*) abandoning clinging (*abhinivesaṃ*), by insight into higher wisdom-dhammas (*adhipaññādhammavipassanā*) abandoning clinging to the essence of appropriation (*sārādānābhinivesaṃ*), by seeing with knowledge of things as they really are (*yathābhūtañāṇadassanena*) abandoning clinging to delusion (*sammohābhinivesaṃ*), by insight into drawbacks (*ādīnavānupassanāya*) abandoning clinging to the home (*ālayābhinivesaṃ*), by reflective insight (*paṭisaṅkhānupassanāya*) abandoning non-reflection (*appaṭisaṅkhaṃ*), and by insight into turning away (*vivaṭṭānupassanāya*) abandoning clinging to attachment (*saṃyogābhinivesaṃ*), having shattered defilements (*kilesa*) associated with wrong views (*diṭṭhi*) by means of the path of stream-entry (*sotāpattimagga*), abandoning coarse defilements (*oḷārike kilese*) by means of the path of once-returning (*sakadāgāmimagga*), uprooting subtle defilements (*aṇusahagate kilese*) by means of the path of non-returning (*anāgāmimagga*), and cutting off all defilements (*sabbakilese*) by means of the path of arahatship (*arahattamagga*) went.\n\nEven so, he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus gone.”\n\nWhy is the *Tathāgata* called so because he has come to the real characteristic? The characteristic of hardness (*kakkhaḷatta-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*) is real, not unreal.\n\nThe characteristic of flowing (*paggharaṇa-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the water element (*āpodhātu*).\n\nThe characteristic of heat (*uṇhatta-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the fire element (*tejodhātu*).\nThe wind element, of distending.\nThe space element, of intangibility.\nThe consciousness element, of cognizing.\nMaterial form, of deformation.\nFeeling, of being felt.\nPerception, of perceiving.\nThe mental formations, of forming.\nConsciousness, of cognizing.\nApplied thought, of application of mind.\nSustained thought, of continued pressure; rapture, of pervading.\nHappiness, of gratification.\nOne-pointedness of mind, of non-distraction.\nContact, of touching.\nThe faculty of faith, of resolution.\nThe faculty of energy, of exertion.\nThe faculty of mindfulness, of awareness.\nThe faculty of concentration, of non-distraction.\nThe faculty of wisdom, of understanding.\nThe power of faith, of not wavering because of faithlessness.\nThe power of energy, of not wavering because of laziness; the power of mindfulness, of not wavering because of forgetfulness.\nThe power of concentration, of not wavering because of restlessness; the power of wisdom, of not wavering because of ignorance.\nThe enlightenment factor of mindfulness, of awareness.\nThe factor of investigation of *dharmas*, of investigating.\nThe factor of energy, of exertion.\nThe factor of rapture, of pervading.\nThe factor of tranquility, of subsiding.\nThe factor of concentration, of non-distraction.\nThe factor of equanimity, of detached observation.\nRight view, of seeing.\nRight intention, of application of mind.\nRight speech, of embracing.\nRight action, of originating.\nRight livelihood, of cleansing.\nRight effort, of exertion.\nRight mindfulness, of awareness.\nRight concentration, of non-distraction.\nIgnorance, of unknowing.\nKamma-formations, of volition.\nConsciousness, of cognizing.\nMentality, of inclining.\nMaterial form has the characteristic of deformation.\nThe six sense bases have the characteristic of actuating.\nContact has the characteristic of touching.\nFeeling has the characteristic of being felt.\nCraving has the characteristic of causing.\nClinging has the characteristic of holding.\nExistence has the characteristic of accumulating.\nBirth has the characteristic of production.\nAging has the characteristic of decaying.\nDeath has the characteristic of passing away.\nThe elements have the characteristic of emptiness.\nThe sense bases have the characteristic of actuating.\nThe foundations of mindfulness have the characteristic of awareness.\nThe right endeavors have the characteristic of endeavoring.\nThe bases of spiritual success have the characteristic of succeeding.\nThe faculties have the characteristic of predominance.\nThe powers have the characteristic of unwavering.\nThe enlightenment factors have the characteristic of emancipating.\nThe path has the characteristic of being a cause.\nThe truths have the characteristic of reality.\nSerenity has the characteristic of non-distraction.\nInsight has the characteristic of contemplation.\nSerenity and insight have the characteristic of having a single flavor.\nThe pairs of complementary opposites have the characteristic of not exceeding one another.\nThe purification of virtue has the characteristic of restraint.\nPurification of mind has the characteristic of non-distraction.\nPurification of view has the characteristic of seeing.\nThe knowledge of destruction has the characteristic of eradication.\nThe knowledge of non-arising has the characteristic of tranquillity.\nDesire has the characteristics of being the root.\nAttention has the characteristic of being the originator.\nContact has the characteristic of collecting together.\nFeeling has the characteristic of convergence.\nConcentration has the characteristic of eminence.\nMindfulness has the characteristic of predominance.\nWisdom has the characteristic of supremacy.\nEmancipation has the characteristic of being the essence… *Nirvāṇa*, the plunge into the deathless, has the characteristic of being the consummation. All these characteristics are real, not unreal.\nThus, through the movement of his faculty of knowledge, he has come to the real characteristic; he has reached it without falling away from it, fully arrived at it—therefore he is the *Tathāgata*.\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has come to the real characteristic.\nHow has the *Tathāgata* awakened to real *dharmas* in accordance with actuality? The real *dharmas* are the four noble truths (*cattāri ariyasaccāni*).\nAs it is said: \"These four things, monks, are real, unerring, not otherwise.\"\n\nWhat are the four? 'This is suffering', monks, this is actual, unerring, not otherwise.\" (Saṃyutta Nikāya).\n\nIn detail.\n\nAnd the Exalted One awakened to those truths. Therefore, because of his awakening to the real *dharmas*, he is called the *Tathāgata*.\n\nHere, the word \"gone\" has the meaning \"awakened\".\n\nFurther, the fact that aging and death originate and commence with birth as condition is real, not unreal, not otherwise... The fact that the *saṅkhāras* (karmic formations) originate and commence with ignorance as condition is real, not unreal, not otherwise... Likewise, the fact that ignorance is the condition for the *saṅkhāras*, the *saṅkhāras* for consciousness... birth for aging and death, is real, not unreal, not otherwise.\n\nAll that the Exalted One awakened to. Therefore, because he awakened to real *dharmas*, he is called the *Tathāgata*.\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he awakened to real *dharmas* in accordance with actuality.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he is a seer of the real? In this world together with its gods... in this generation with its rulers and its men, whatever visible-form object there is that enters the threshold of the eye-door of the innumerable beings throughout the innumerable world systems—that the Exalted One knows and sees in all its modes.\n\nAnd knowing and seeing it thus, as desirable or undesirable, etc., and as found under the applicable term among the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized.\n\n\"What is that material form, the *rūpa-āyatana* (sense sphere of form)? That material form derivative upon the four primary elements that is of colored appearance, visible, impinging, blue, yellow,\" etc. . He has analyzed it under numerous names, in thirteen sections, and by fifty-two methods. This is real, not unreal.\n\nThe same method applies to sounds entering the threshold of the ear-door and so forth.\n\nFor the Exalted One has said: \"In this world, monks, together with its gods... in this generation with its rulers and its men, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, or examined by the mind—that I know.\n\nThat I have directly known. That the *Tathāgata* has understood. But the *Tathāgata* does not take a stand upon it.\"\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he is a seer of the real.\n\nHere the term \"*Tathāgata*\" should be understood to mean a seer of the real.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he is a speaker of the real? From the night when the Exalted One, sitting in the invincible posture on the terrace of enlightenment, crushed the heads of the three *Māras* and awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, to the night when he attained *parinibbāna* in the *nibbāna*-element without residue while lying between the twin *Sāl* trees, whatever the Exalted One spoke, whether in the first, middle, or final periods following the enlightenment—the discourses, mixed prose and verse... all that is impeccable in meaning and wording, neither deficient nor excessive, complete in every way, destroying the intoxication of passion, destroying the intoxication of hatred and delusion.\n\nThere is not even as much as a hair’s tip in this that is defective. It all appears as though it had been stamped with a single seal, measured with a single ruler, or weighed upon a single pair of scales. It is all real, not unreal.\n\nAs it is said: \"Between the night when the *Tathāgata* awakens to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains *parinibbāna* in the *nibbāna*-element without residue, whatever he speaks, utters, or expounds—all that is real, not otherwise.\n\nTherefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.\"\n\nFor here the word *gata* has the meaning of enunciation.\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he is a speaker of the real.\n\nFurther, the word *āgada* or *āgadana* means “pronouncement”; that is, a statement.\n\nHis pronouncement is real and undistorted. Thus, changing the letter *d* to a *t*; the derivation of the word “*Tathāgata*” may be understood in this sense.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he practices what he teaches? The bodily action of the Exalted One conforms to his speech, and his speech conforms to his bodily action; therefore he is one who practices what he teaches and teaches what he practices.\n\nSince he is of such a nature, his bodily action has “gone thus,” proceeding in accordance with his speech.\n\nand his speech has “gone thus,” proceeding in accordance with his bodily action; thus he is the *Tathāgata*.\n\nAs it is said: \"As the *Tathāgata* speaks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks.\n\nSince he does as he speaks and speaks as he does.\n\nTherefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.\"\nni.\n4. 23).\nThus, he is the *Tathāgata* because he acts in accordance with his teaching.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing? From the peak of existence (*bhava-agga*) downwards, and from the *Avīci* hell upwards, throughout the innumerable world systems (*lokadhātu*), the *Tathāgata* surpasses all beings in virtue (*śīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), wisdom (*prajñā*), and emancipation (*vimutti*), and knowledge-and-vision of emancipation (*vimutti-ñāṇa-dassana*). There is none his equal or measure. He is unequalled (*atula*), immeasurable (*appameyya*), incomparable (*anuttara*)—the king of kings (*rājātirājā*), the god of gods (*devadeva*), the *Śakka* above all *Śakkas*, the *Brahmā* above all *Brahmās*.\n\nThus it is said: “In this world, *bhikkhus*, together with its gods, etc., in this generation with its rulers and its men, the *Tathāgata* is the vanquisher (*abhibhū*), the unvanquished (*anabhibhūto*), the universal seer (*aññadatthudaso*), the wielder of power (*vasavattī*). Therefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.”\n\nHere the word-derivation (*padasiddhi*) should be understood as follows.\n\nLike a medicine (*agada*).\n\nWho is this? His elegance of teaching (*desanāvilāsamayo*) and his accumulation of merit (*puññussayo*).\n\nFor by means of these, he vanquishes all the rival teachers as well as this world together with its gods in the same way that a powerful physician (*bhisakko*) vanquishes snakes with a divine medicine (*dibbāgadena*).\n\nThus his medicine (*agado*) for vanquishing all the world is his real, undistorted elegance of teaching (*desanāvilāsamayo*) and his accumulations of merit (*puññussayo*).\n\nChanging the letter *da* to a *ta*, the derivation of the word “*Tathāgata*” may be understood thus.\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* in the sense of vanquishing (*abhibhavanaṭṭhena*).\n\nFurthermore, he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “gone through reality” (*tathāya gato*), and because he has “really gone” (*tathaṃ gato*).\n\nHere “gone” (*gato*) has the meanings of undergone (*avagato*), gone beyond (*atīto*), attained (*patto*), and practiced (*paṭipanno*).\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., undergone (*avagato*)—reality by fully understanding the entire world (*sakalaloka*) through the scrutinization (*tīraṇapariññāya*).\n\nHe is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., gone beyond (*atīto*)—reality by fully understanding the world through the abandonment of its origin (*lokasamudayaṃ pahānapariññāya*).\n\nHe is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., attained (*patto*)—reality by realizing the cessation of the world (*lokanirodhaṃ sacchikiriyāya*).\n\nAnd he is the *Tathāgata* because he has really gone along—i.e., practiced (*paṭipanno*)—the way leading to the cessation of the world (*lokanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ tathaṃ gato*).\n\nThus it was said by the Exalted One (*bhagavatā*) - Thus the meaning should be understood.\n\nBut this is the mere introduction (*mukhamattaṃ*) to the explanation of the nature of a *Tathāgata* (*tathāgatabhāva-dīpane*).\n\nFor only a *Tathāgata* himself can explain the nature of a *Tathāgata* (*tathāgatabhāvaṃ*) in its completeness (*sabbākārena*).\n\nWhat, *bhikkhus*, is that by which an ordinary person (*puthujjana*) speaking the praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) of the *Tathāgata* might speak, asking, \"What is that?\". Therein, what is a question (*pucchā*)? A question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*), a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*), a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*), a question of consent (*anumatipucchā*), a question of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatā pucchā*)—it is fivefold (*pañcavidhā hoti*).\n\nTherein, what is a question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) the characteristic (*lakkhaṇaṃ*) is unknown (*aññātaṃ hoti*), unseen (*adiṭṭhaṃ*), unweighed (*atulitaṃ*), uninvestigated (*atīritaṃ*), undeveloped (*avibhūtaṃ*), unmanifested (*avibhāvitaṃ*). He asks a question (*pañhaṃ pucchati*) for the knowledge (*ñāṇāya*), seeing (*dassanāya*), weighing (*tulanāya*), investigating (*tīraṇāya*), and manifestation (*vibhāvanāya*) of it. This is a question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) the characteristic (*lakkhaṇaṃ*) is known (*ñātaṃ hoti*), seen (*diṭṭhaṃ*), weighed (*tulitaṃ*), investigated (*tīritaṃ*), developed (*vibhūtaṃ*), and manifested (*vibhāvitaṃ*).

This is a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) there is a tendency to doubt (*saṃsayapakkhando hoti*), a tendency to uncertainty (*vimatipakkhando*), being of two minds (*dveḷhakajāto*): \"Is it thus (*evaṃ nu kho*), or is it not thus (*na nu kho*), what is it (*kinnu kho*), how is it (*kathaṃ nu kho*)?\".\n\nHe asks a question (*pañhaṃ pucchati*) for the purpose of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanatthāya*).\n\nThis is a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of consent (*anumatipucchā*)? The Exalted One (*bhagavā*) asks the *bhikkhus* a question out of consent (*anumatiyā pañhaṃ pucchati*) – \"What do you think (*taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave*), is form (*rūpaṃ*) permanent (*niccaṃ*) or impermanent (*aniccaṃ vā*)\"?\n\nImpermanent (*aniccaṃ*), venerable sir (*bhante*).\n\nIs that which is impermanent (*yaṃ panāniccaṃ*), suffering (*dukkhaṃ*) or happiness (*sukhaṃ vā*)? Suffering (*dukkhaṃ*), venerable sir (*bhante*).\n\nEverything should be spoken (*sabbaṃ vattabbaṃ*), this is a question of consent (*ayaṃ anumatipucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatā pucchā*)? The Exalted One (*bhagavā*) asks the *bhikkhus* a question out of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatāya pañhaṃ pucchati*).\n\nThere are these four foundations of mindfulness (*cattārome, bhikkhave, satipaṭṭhānā*).\n\nWhat are the four (*katame cattāro*)? ... These are the eight constituents of the path (*aṭṭhime bhikkhave maggaṅgā*).\n\nWhat are the eight (*katame aṭṭha*)? This is a question of wanting to speak (*ayaṃ kathetukamyatā pucchā*).\n\nThus, in these five questions, since there is no unseen quality (*adiṭṭhassa dhammassa*) of any kind, therefore there is no question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*) for the *Tathāgata*.\n\nSince the thought does not even arise (*samannāhārasseva anuppajjanato*), “I will compare it (*saṃsanditvā desessāmi*) with other learned ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (*aññehi paṇḍitehi samaṇabrāhmaṇehi saddhiṃ*),\" therefore there is also no question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchāpi natthi*).\n\nSince there is no wavering (*āsappanā parisappanā natthi*) in even one quality for the Buddhas (*buddhānaṃ ekadhammepi*), all doubts are cut off (*sabbā kaṅkhā chinnā*) at the *Bodhi* tree (*bodhimaṇḍeyeva*); therefore there is certainly no question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchāpi natthiyeva*).\n\nBut the remaining two questions (*avasesā pana dve pucchā*) exist for the Buddhas (*buddhānaṃ atthi*), among those this is called a question of wanting to speak (*ayaṃ kathetukamyatā pucchā nāma*).",

    "commentary_english": "8. Now, desiring to explain that which was asked in the question, [the text] begins with \"Having abandoned killing living beings\".\n\nThere, *pāṇātipāta* is the transgression against living beings, *pāṇavadha* is the killing of living beings, and *pāṇaghāta* is the destruction of living beings.\n\nHere, the word *pāṇa* conventionally signifies a being ( *satta*), but in the ultimate sense ( *paramattha*), it is the life-faculty ( *jīvitindriya*). \"Killing living beings\" ( *pāṇātipāta*) is the volition ( *cetanā*) of killing in one who perceives a living being as such, which occurs through one of the doors of body or speech, and initiates the act of cutting off that living being’s life-faculty.\n\nIn the case of beings devoid of moral qualities such as animals, the act of killing is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the being is small ( *khuddake*) in size, and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjo*) when the body is large ( *mahāsarīre*). Why? Because of the magnitude of the effort ( *payogamahantatāya*).\n\nAnd when the effort ( *payoga*) involved is equal, it depends on the magnitude of the object ( *vatthu*).\n\nIn the case of beings endowed with moral qualities such as humans, the act of killing is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the being has few moral qualities ( *appaguṇe*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjo*) when the being has many moral qualities ( *mahāguṇe*).\n\nWhen the size of the body and moral qualities are equal, however, it should be understood that it is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the defilements ( *kilesānaṃ*) and activity ( *upakkamānañca*) are mild ( *mudutāya*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjoti* ) when they are strong ( *tibbatāya*).\n\nThere are five constituents for this: a living being ( *pāṇo*), awareness that it is a living being ( *pāṇasaññitā*), the mind to kill ( *vadhakacittaṃ*), activity ( *upakkamo*), and the death thereby ( *tena maraṇaṃ*).\n\nThere are six means: one’s own person ( *sāhatthiko*), command ( *āṇattiko*), a missile ( *nissaggiyo*), a fixed contrivance ( *thāvaro*), a magical spell ( *vijjāmayo*), supernormal power ( *iddhimayo*).\n\nWhen this meaning is expanded, it becomes excessively complex ( *papañco*). Therefore, we shall not expand upon it, but [discuss] something else of this nature.\n\nThose who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the *Samantapāsādika*, the Vinaya Commentary.\n\n\"Having abandoned\" means having abandoned this bad conduct ( *dussīlyaṃ*), known as the thought of killing living beings ( *pāṇātipātacetanāsaṅkhātaṃ*).\n\n\"Abstaining\" means truly abstaining from that bad conduct, beginning from the time of abandoning it.\n\n\"There is no thought of transgressing\" means that, just as with physical actions, the meaning should be understood in the same way in other such passages with regard to things cognizable by the eye and ear.\n\n*Samaṇa* means the Blessed One ( *bhagavā*) who has gained the designation because he has calmed evil ( *samitapāpatāya laddhavohāro*).\n\n*Gotama* [is used] because of [his] lineage ( *gottavasena*).\n\nIt is not only the Blessed One ( *bhagavāyeva*) who abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato*), but the community of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅghopi*) also abstains ( *paṭivirato*). The teaching ( *desanā*) has come thus from the beginning ( *ādito paṭṭhāya evaṃ āgatā*), but it is fitting for one who is explaining the meaning ( *atthaṃ pana dīpentena*) to also explain it in terms of the community of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅghavasenāpi dīpetuṃ vaṭṭati*).\n\n\"Having laid down the stick, having laid down the weapon\" means that the meaning is \"because he does not wield a stick or weapon to harm others, he has laid down the stick and laid down the weapon\".\n\nHere, it should be understood that after setting aside the stick ( *daṇḍaṃ*), all the remaining equipment ( *avasesaṃ upakaraṇaṃ*) is a weapon ( *sattham*) because it has the nature of harming beings ( *sattānaṃ viheṭhanabhāvato satthanti veditabbaṃ*).\n\nBut that which monks, having taken a knife, a tooth-stick, an axe, or a razor, wander about with, that is not for harming others ( *parūpaghātatthāya*).\n\nTherefore, he is called one who has laid down the stick, who has laid down the weapon ( *nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*).\n\n\"Conscientious\" ( *lajjīti*) means possessed of conscientiousness ( *lajjāya samannāgato*) characterized by disgust for evil ( *pāpajigucchanalakkhaṇāya*).\n\n\"Compassionate\" means one who has attained compassion ( *dayaṃ āpanno*) and a mind of loving-kindness ( *mettacittataṃ*).\n\n\"Having compassion for the welfare of all living beings\" means he is compassionate with a mind to benefit all living beings ( *sabbe pāṇabhūte hitena anukampako*).\n\nThe meaning is that through this attainment of compassion ( *dayāpannatāya*), there is a mind to benefit all living beings ( *sabbesaṃ pāṇabhūtānaṃ hitacittakoti attho*).\n\n\"Dwells\" means poses, moves, guards, persists, carries on, lives, dwells ( *iriyati yapeti yāpeti pāleti*).\n\nThus, or indeed, monks.\n\nThe word \"or\" is said to be used above in the sense of option, having considered \"Having abandoned taking what is not given\", etc. Thus, everywhere, the nature of option should be understood having considered what comes before or what comes after.\n\nNow, here is a summary: Monks, when a worldling ( *puthujjano*) speaks the praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vadamāno*) of the Tathāgata ( *Tathāgatassa*), he would say thus: \"The ascetic ( *samaṇo*) Gotama does not kill ( *na hanati*) a living being ( *pāṇaṃ*), nor does he cause [another] to kill ( *na ghāteti*), nor does he approve ( *na tattha samanuñño hoti*) of it. He abstains ( *virato*) from this evil conduct ( *imasmā dussīlyā*). Oh, how great are the qualities of the Buddha ( *buddhaguṇā mahantā*)!\" Thus, having made a great effort ( *mahantaṃ ussāhaṃ katvā*), even though he wishes to speak praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vattukāmopi*), he would only speak ( *vakkhati*) of a trifling and insignificant amount ( *appamattakaṃ oramattakaṃ*)—mere virtue and [good] conduct ( *ācārasīlamattakameva*).\n\nRelying upon the extraordinary qualities above ( *upari asādhāraṇabhāvaṃ nissāya*), he will not be able to speak praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vattuṃ na sakkhissati*).\n\nIt is not only the worldling ( *puthujjanova*), but even stream-enterers ( *sotāpanna*), once-returners ( *sakadāgāmi*), non-returners ( *anāgāmi*), *arhats* ( *arahanto*) and even *paccekabuddhas* ( *paccekabuddhāpi*) are not able ( *na sakkonti*). Only the *Tathāgata* ( *Tathāgatoyeva*) is able ( *sakkoti*). We will speak of that above ( *taṃ vo upari vakkhāmi*). This is a meaningful explanation ( *ayamettha sādhippāyā atthavaṇṇanā*).\n\nFrom here on ( *ito paraṃ pana*) we will explain only the words that have not been explained previously ( *apubbapadameva vaṇṇayissāma*).\n\nIn \"Having abandoned taking what is not given\" ( *adinnādānaṃ pahāyāti*), taking what is not given ( *adinnassa ādānaṃ*) is *adinnādāna*, the carrying off of another’s goods ( *parasaṃharaṇaṃ*), stealing ( *theyyaṃ*), robbery ( *corikāti vuttaṃ hoti*).\n\nThere ( *tattha*), \"what is not given\" ( *adinnanti*) is what is possessed by another ( *parapariggahitaṃ*), where another person, exercising free control as he wishes ( *yathākāmakāritaṃ āpajjanto*), is neither liable to punishment nor blame ( *adaṇḍāraho anupavajjo ca hoti*).\n\nIn the case of that which is possessed by another ( *tasmiṃ parapariggahite*), the volition of theft ( *theyyacetanā*) in one who perceives it as possessed by another ( *parapariggahitasaññino*), which initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thing ( *tadādāyakaupakkamasamuṭṭhāpikā*), is \"taking what is not given\" ( *adinnādānaṃ*).\n\nThat ( *taṃ* ) is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjaṃ*) in the case of another's property of low value ( *hīne parasantake*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjaṃ*) when it is of high value ( *paṇīte*). Why? Because of the value of the object ( *vatthupaṇītatāya*).\n\nWhen the objects are equal in value ( *vatthusamatte sati*), the act is more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjaṃ*) when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities ( *guṇādhikānaṃ santake vatthusmiṃ*).\n\nTaking that very thing ( *taṃ taṃ*) from one with superior qualities ( *guṇādhikaṃ upādāya*), the act is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjaṃ*) when the object belongs to one of inferior qualities ( *hīnaguṇassa santake vatthusmiṃ*) compared to that ( *tato tato*).\n\nThere are five components of this ( *tassa pañca sambhārā honti*): property belonging to another ( *parapariggahitaṃ*), the perception of the property belonging to another as such ( *parapariggahitasaññitā*), the thought of stealing ( *theyyacittaṃ*), the act ( *upakkamo*), and the removal of the article ( *tena haraṇanti*).\nThere are six means: one's own person, etc. ( *sāhatthikādayova*).\nAnd these may be classified, according to the way in which they occur, by way of the following: taking by theft (*theyyāvahāro*), by force (*pasayhāvahāro*), by concealment (*paṭicchannāvahāro*), by stratagem (*parikappāvahāro*), by fraud (*kusāvahāro*). This here is in brief (*ayamettha saṅkhepo*).\nThe details, however, are given in the Samantapasadika.\n\"He takes only what is given,\" therefore he is a taker of what is given (*dinnādāyī*).\n\"Even with his mind, he only anticipates what has been given,\" therefore, he is one who anticipates only what has been given (*dinnapāṭikaṅkhī*).\n*Theṇa* means a thief (*theno*).\nNot by theft, by non-theft (*athenena*).\nIndeed, through non-theft, he abides in purity (*sucibhūtena*).\n*Attanā* means by way of self-nature (*attabhāvena*).\nIt is said that by making that non-theft the pure self, he dwells (in purity) (*athenaṃ sucibhūtaṃ attānaṃ katvā viharatīti vuttaṃ hoti*).\nThe remainder should be connected in the same way as stated in the first precept (*sesaṃ paṭhamasikkhāpade vuttanayeneva yojetabbaṃ*).\nAnd as in this case, so with all (*yathā ca idha, evaṃ sabbattha*).\n*Abrahmacariya* means uncelibate conduct (*aseṭṭhacariyaṃ*).\nOne who practices the highest conduct, the *brahma*, is a *brahmacārī*.\n*Ārācārī* means one who keeps far from uncelibate conduct (*abrahmacariyato dūracārī*).\n*Methuna* means unrighteous practices (*asaddhammā*) that have attained the designation *methuna*, because they are similar due to being overcome by passion (*rāgapariyuṭṭhānavasena sadisattā methunakāti*), and because they should be avoided by those who have obtained the designation.\n*Gāmadhamma* means the practices of village dwellers (*gāmavāsīnaṃ dhammā*).",

    "commentary_english": "9. Having abandoned false speech, here, *musā* (falsehood) is vocal or bodily effort destroying the welfare of others, preceded by deception. \"False speech\" is the volition with the intention to deceive, which brings about bodily or vocal effort to deceive others.\n\nAnother method: \"False\" (*musā*) means an unreal, untrue case (*abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ vatthu*).\n\n\"Speech\" (*vādo*) is the communication of that as being real, true.\n\nAccording to characteristic, \"false speech\" is the volition of one desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true, which initiates such an act of communication.\n\nThis is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight, and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great.\n\nFurther, when a householder, reluctant to part with a certain possession, denies that he owns it, it is of little blame; but when he is called to witness and lies for the sake of destroying another’s welfare, then the blame is heavy. For monks, the blame is light when they exaggerate in jest, e. g. , if after getting a little oil or ghee they say, “Oil flows like a river in the village today.” But the blame is heavy when they claim to have seen something they did not see.\n\nThere are four constituents of this act: an untrue case (*atathaṃ vatthu*), the mind to deceive (*visaṃvādanacittaṃ*), the appropriate effort (*tajjo vāyāmo*), the communicating of that meaning to another (*parassa tadatthavijānananti*).\n\nThere is one means, one’s own person only (*eko प्रयोगो साहत्थिकोव*).\n\nThat is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of speech.\n\nIf, through that action, the other understands that meaning, one is bound by the *kamma* of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the action.\n\nSince one deceives another through body, or through something attached to the body, or through speech, so too, one deceives another by ordering, \"Tell him this!”, or by writing a document, or by placing something in front [of someone], or by writing on walls and so on, \"This meaning is to be regarded thus.\"\n\nTherefore, here, applications such as command, relinquishment, and firmness are fitting. However, in the commentaries, because it is not in the future, it should be considered and taken up.\n\nSpeaking truth (*saccaṃ vadatīti*) is the truth-speaker (*saccavādī*).\n\nHe connects truth with truth and brings it about, therefore he is truth-connected (*saccasandho*).\n\nThe meaning is that he does not speak falsehood intermittently (*na antarantarā musā vadatīti attho*).\n\nFor if a person sometimes speaks falsehood and sometimes speaks truth, because truth is interrupted by falsehood, truth is not connected with truth; therefore, he is not truth-connected (*na saccasandho*).\n\nBut this person is not like that; even for the sake of his life, he does not speak falsehood, and he connects truth with truth; therefore, he is truth-connected (*saccasandho*).\n\n*Theto* means firm; the meaning is one with firm speech (*thiro thirakathoti attho*).\n\nFor one person, like turmeric dye, or like a stake stuck in a heap of chaff, or like a gourd placed on a donkey's back, is not one with firm speech; another person, like a line on a stone, or like Indra's post, is one with firm speech. Even if his head is cut off with a sword, he does not speak two speeches; this is called firm (*theto*).\n\nTrustworthy (*paccayiko*) means one who should be trusted, one who should be believed; this is the meaning.\n\nFor one person is not trustworthy; when it is said, \"This was spoken by whom? By so-and-so,\" he incurs the condition of being spoken to [by others], \"Do not trust his word\".\n\nOne person is trustworthy; when it is said, “This was spoken by whom? By so-and-so,” he incurs the condition of being spoken to [by others], “If it was spoken by him, this is indeed the measure; now there is no need to examine it; it is just like this.” This one is called trustworthy (*paccayiko*).\n\nHe does not deceive the world; the meaning is that, by means of that truth-speaking, he does not deceive the world (*avisaṃvādako lokassāti tāya saccavāditāya lokaṃ na visaṃvādetīti attho*).\n\nHaving abandoned malicious speech (*pisuṇaṃvācaṃ pahāya*), etc.: The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness for another is malicious speech (*sā pisuṇā vācā*).\n\nThe kind of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh, the kind of speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant neither to the ear nor to the heart — that is harsh speech (*pharusā vācā*).\n\nThat by which one gossips idly, without meaning, is gossip (*samphappalāpo*).\n\nAlso, the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name “malicious speech,” etc. And that only is intended here (*idhādhippetāti*).\n\nTherein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind (*saṃkiliṭṭhacittassa*), which initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among others or to endear oneself.\n\nThe act is less blameworthy when the person one divides has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.\n\nIts constituents are four: another person to be divided, the intention to divide, “Thus these will be separated and split” or the desire to endear oneself, “Thus I shall become loved and intimate,” the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to that person.\n\n\"For division of these\": it is for the division of those to whom it has been said and who have heard it in their presence.\n\n\"Or uniting those who are divided\": the doer and instigator is one who approaches each of two friends or those with a common teacher etc. who have been divided for some reason or other, and says, \"This is not right for you who were born in such a family and are so learned\" etc., and makes a connection.\n\nNon-giving of connection means the non-bestowal of connection (*sandhānānuppadātā*).\n\nHaving seen two united people, and having said - \"This is unbecoming for you who are born in such a family, who are endowed with such qualities\" etc., the meaning is that he is the doer of firm action (*daḷhīkammaṃ kattāti attho*).\n\nA park is united to him, therefore it is a united park (*samaggārāmo*).\n\nThe meaning is that he does not wish to live where there is no unity (*yattha samaggā natthi, tattha vasitumpi na icchatīti attho*).\n\n*Samaggarāmotipi* is the *pāḷi*, this itself is the meaning here.\n\n\"Delighting in unity\" means one who delights in those who are united; he does not wish to go elsewhere, having abandoned them; this is the meaning.\n\nHe delights, having seen or heard those who are united, therefore, he is one who delights in unity (*samagganandī*). Speaking speech that makes for unity (*samaggakaraṇiṃ vācaṃ bhāsitāti*): that speech which makes beings completely united, that speech speaks only of making clear the quality of unity, not another.\nHarsh speech is an entirely harsh thought that arises from an action of wounding the vital feelings of another through bodily or vocal means.\n\nThis is an example given for the purpose of making it clear: A village boy, it is said, went to the forest without heeding his mother’s words. Unable to make him turn back, she scolded him angrily, saying: “May a wild buffalo chase you!”\n\nThen a buffalo appeared before him right there in the forest.\n\nThe boy made an asseveration of truth, saying: “Let it not be as my mother said but as she thought!”\n\nThe buffalo stood as though tied there.\n\nThus, although the means was that of wounding the vital feelings, because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech.\n\nFor parents sometimes tell their children: “May robbers cut you into bits!” But in truth they do not want even a lotus leaf to fall on them.\n\nAnd preceptors and teachers sometimes say to their pupils: “What is the use with you shameless rascals. Get out!” Yet they wish their success in study and spiritual achievement.\n\nJust as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh, so through gentleness of speech, speech does not become unharsh.\n\nFor the words “Let him sleep in peace” spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech, but because of harshness of mind it is indeed harsh speech.\n\nIt is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.\n\nIts constituents are three: another to be abused, an angry mind, the abusing.\n\n\"Nela\" means \"fault\" (*doṣa*). Because there is no *ela* in it, it is *nela*, meaning without fault (*nirdoṣa*).\n\nFor example, “*nelaṅgo setapacchādo*”.\n\n(65) Here, it is like *nela* that was spoken.\n\n\"Pleasing to the ear\" (*kaṇṇasukha*) means pleasing to the ears because of the sweetness of the consonants. It does not produce ear-pain like being pierced by a needle.\n\n\"Arousing affection\" (*pemanīya*) means that it arouses affection by not producing anger in the whole body because of the sweetness of the meaning.\n\n\"Grasping the heart\" (*hadayaṅgama*) means that it goes to the heart and enters the mind pleasantly without being resisted.\n\n\"Noble\" (*porī*) means that it is perfect in virtue, comes to be in the city, is tender like a woman brought up in the city.\n\nIt is \"noble\" (*porī*) because it is of the city.\n\nIt means the speech of city-dwellers.\n\nFor city-dwellers have speech that is appropriate.\n\nThey call one who has only affection \"father\" (*pitā*), they call one who has only brightness \"brother\" (*bhātā*), they call one who has only measuring \"mother\" (*mātā*).\n\nBecause speech of such a kind is pleasing to many people, it is \"pleasing to many people\" (*bahujanakantā*).\n\nBecause it is pleasing to the mind and increases thought for many people just through its state of being pleasing, it is \"agreeable to many people\" (*bahujanamanāpā*).\n\nHaving abandoned idle chatter “Idle chatter” is the unwholesome volition occasioning the bodily or vocal effort to communicate something useless.\n\nIt is less blameworthy when indulgence is mild, more blameworthy when indulgence is great. There are two components: the disposition to engage in useless talk, such us talk on the great war of India or the abduction of Sītā, and the act of engaging in such talk.\n\n\"Speaking at the right time\" (*kālavādī*) means that he speaks after considering the appropriate time for speaking.\n\n\"Speaking the truth\" (*bhūtavādī*) means that he speaks of what is true, factual, and in accordance with reality.\n\n\"Speaking with a purpose\" (*atthavādī*) means that he speaks having relied only on the benefits of what is visible in this life and what will arise in future lives.\n\n\"Speaking the Dharma\" (*dhammavādī*) means that he speaks having relied on the nine supramundane *dharmas*. \"Speaking the Vinaya\" (*vinayavādī*) means that he speaks having relied on restraint, discipline, and abandonment discipline.\n\n\"Treasure\" (*nidhāna*) means a place for storing. Because there is a store in her, she is \"treasure-filled\" (*nidhānavatī*).\n\nIt means that she speaks speech that is appropriate for storing in the heart.\n\nBecause he always shines with timeliness, he does not speak out of season saying, “I will speak speech filled with treasure” but rather, he speaks only after giving consideration to what is the right time.\n\n\"With a pretext\" (*sāpadesa*) means with a simile (*saupama*), meaning with a reason (*sakāraṇa*).\n\n\"Having a limit\" (*pariyantavatinti*) means that after showing a demarcation, he speaks in such a way that its demarcation is understood.\n\n\"Connected with meaning\" (*atthasaṃhita*) means that because it is impossible to fully express it with many different means, he speaks speech endowed with meaning.\n\nOr, because that speaker of meaning (*atthavādī*) speaks with meaning (*attha*), through being connected with that meaning, he speaks speech connected with meaning (*atthasaṃhita*). It has been said that he does not set aside one thing and speak of another.",

    "commentary_english": "10. *Bījagāmabhūtagāmasamārambhāti*: “The undertaking of seed-group and being-group” means disrupting, by way of cutting, splitting, cooking, etc., the undertaking of the five kinds of seed-group, namely, *mūlabīja* (root-seed), *skandhabīja* (trunk-seed), *phaḷubīja* (shoot-seed), *agrabīja* (tip-seed), and *bījabīja* (seed-seed); as well as the being-group of any blue grass, tree, etc. from whatever source. This is the meaning.\n\n*Ekabhattikoti*: “Taking one meal” means the two meals: the morning meal (*pātarāsabhatta*) and the evening meal (*sāyamāsabhatta*). Among those, the morning meal is limited by the time before midday (*antomajjhanhikena*), the other [meal] is from midday upwards until dawn (*anto aruṇena*).\n\nTherefore, even someone eating ten times during before midday (*antomajjhanhike*), is still someone who takes one meal (*ekabhattikova*).\n\nWith reference to this, it is said, “one who takes one meal” (*ekabhattiko*).\n\n*Rattiyā bhojanaṃ ratti*, eating at night is night, ceasing from that, is ceasing from night (*rattūparato*).\n\nAfter midday (*majjhanhike*) until sunset (*sūriyatthaṅgamanā*), eating is called unseasonable eating (*vikālabhojanaṃ*).\n\nHaving ceased from that, one abstains from unseasonable eating (*vikālabhojanā*).\n\nWhen did he abstain? From the day of renouncing on the bank of the Anomā River (*anomānadītīre pabbajitadivasato paṭṭhāya*).\n\nBecause it is not in accordance with the teaching (*sāsanassa ananulomattā*), showing what is disorderly and improper (*visūkaṃ paṭāṇībhūtaṃ dassanaṃ*) is *visūkadassanaṃ* (improper seeing).\n\nBy oneself dancing, causing to dance, etc., dance (*naccā*) and song (*gītā*) and instrumental music (*vāditā*), even ultimately seeing dance etc. flourishing like peacock dances etc. (*mayūranaccādivasenapi pavattānaṃ naccādīnaṃ*) is a disorderly showing (*visūkabhūtā dassanā*), thus *naccagītavāditavisūkadassanā* (dance, song, instrumental music, improper seeing).\n\nFor monks and nuns, it is not proper to cause dance etc. (*naccādīni*) to be performed by oneself, or to cause [them] to be performed by others, or to see performances (*passituṃ*).\n\nAmong garlands etc., a garland (*mālā*) is whatever kind of flower (*pupphaṃ*).\n\nSmell (*gandho*) is whatever kind of fragrant substance (*gandhajātaṃ*).\n\nUnguent (*vilepanaṃ*) is causing color to the skin (*chavirāgakaraṇaṃ*).\n\nThere, wearing, it is called sustaining (*dhāreti*), filling what is lacking, it is called adorning (*maṇḍeti*), enjoying through the scent and through the color of the skin, it is called beautifying (*vibhūseti*).\n\n*Ṭhānaṃ* (basis) is called cause (*kāraṇaṃ*).\n\nTherefore, whatever flowers, garlands etc. (*mālādhāraṇādīni*) the masses do with immoral intention (*dussīlyacetanāya*), abstaining from that is the meaning.\n\nHigh couches (*uccāsayanaṃ*) are called exceeding the measure (*pamāṇātikkantaṃ*).\n\nLarge couches (*mahāsayananti*) are improper spreads (*akappiyapaccattharaṇaṃ*).\n\nAbstaining from that (*tato*), is the meaning.\n\nGold (*suvaṇṇaṃ*) is the noble metal (*jātarūpaṃ*).\n\nSilver (*rajataṃ*) is a *kahāpaṇa* coin, a copper *māsaka* coin, a resin *māsaka* coin, a wooden *māsaka* coin—whatever is used in commerce (*vohāraṃ gacchanti*).\n\nAbstaining from accepting both of those (*tassa ubhayassāpi paṭiggahaṇā*), he neither takes it himself (*na uggaṇhāti*), nor causes another to take it (*na uggaṇhāpeti*), nor approves of what has been put aside (*na upanikkhittaṃ sādiyatīti*). This is the meaning.\n\n*Āmakadhaññapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting raw grain” [means] accepting even the seven kinds of raw grain (*āmakadhaññassa*), enumerated as rice (*sāli*), *vīhi*, barley (*yava*), wheat (*godhūma*), *kaṅgu*, *varaka*, and *kudrūsaka*.\n\nNot only accepting those (*na kevalañca etesaṃ paṭiggahaṇameva*), but even touching them (*āmasanampi*) is not proper for monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ na vaṭṭatiyeva*).\n\n*Āmakamaṃsapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting raw meat” means here, except when it is specially allowed (*aññatra odissa anuññātā*), accepting raw meat and fish (*āmakamaṃsamacchānaṃ paṭiggahaṇameva*) is not proper for monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ na vaṭṭati*), not even touching [them] (*no āmasanaṃ*).\n\n*Itthikumārikapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting women and girls” means here, a woman (*itthī*) is one who has gone in between men (*purisantaragatā*), the other is called a girl (*kumārikā nāma*). Accepting and touching those (*tāsaṃ paṭiggahaṇampi āmasanampi*) is simply improper (*akappiyameva*).\n\n*Dāsidāsapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting male and female slaves” means here, accepting those (*tesaṃ paṭiggahaṇaṃ*) is not proper only by means of [them being] male and female slaves (*dāsidāsavaseneva*).\n\n“I give a monastic attendant (*kappiyakārakaṃ dammi*), I give a gardener (*ārāmikaṃ dammī*)”—when it is said thus (*evaṃ vutte*), it is proper (*vaṭṭati*).\n\nAmong sheep and goats etc. (*ajeḷakādīsu*), regarding fields, building sites and boundaries (*khettavatthupariyosānesu*), the principle of what is proper and improper (*kappiyākappiyanayo*) should be investigated according to the Vinaya (*vinayavasena upaparikkhitabba*).\n\nThere, a field (*khettaṃ nāma*) is that in which spring crops grow (*yasmiṃ pubbaṇṇaṃ ruhati*).\n\nA building site (*vatthu nāma*) is that in which autumn crops grow (*yasmiṃ aparaṇṇaṃ ruhati*).\n\nOr where both grow (*yattha vā ubhayampi ruhati*), that is a field (*taṃ khettaṃ*).\n\nLand prepared for that purpose (*tadatthāya akatabhūmibhāgo*) is a building site (*vatthu*).\n\nBy the head of fields and building sites (*khettavatthusīsena*), here also, ponds and tanks etc. (*vāpitaḷākādīnipi*) are included (*saṅgahitāneva*).\n\n*Dūteyyaṃ vuccati* is called the work of a messenger (*dūtakammaṃ*), taking a letter or message (*paṇṇaṃ vā sāsanaṃ vā gahetvā*) sent by laypeople (*gihīnaṃ pahitaṃ*) and going there and there (*tattha tattha gamanaṃ*).\n\n*Pahiṇagamanaṃ vuccati* is called the minor going (*khuddakagamanaṃ*) of one sent from house to house (*gharā gharaṃ pesitassa*).\n\n*Anuyogo nāma* is called doing both of those (*tadubhayakaraṇaṃ*).\n\nTherefore, *anuyogāti* is [called] the practice of messengers and errand-goers (*dūteyyapahiṇagamanānaṃ*).\nIn this way, the meaning should be understood here.\n*Kayavikkayā* means *kaya* and *vikkayā*.\nIn *tulākūṭa*, etc., *kūṭa* means deception.\nThere, *tulākūṭa* is of four kinds, namely: *rūpakūṭa*, *aṅgakūṭa*, *gahaṇakūṭa*, and *paṭicchannakūṭa*.\nThere, *rūpakūṭa* means making two equal balances, taking with a large [weight], and giving with a small one.\n*Aṅgakūṭa* means, while taking, pressing the balance with the hand on the back side, and while giving, [pressing] the front side.\n*Gahaṇakūṭa* means, while taking, grasping the rope at the root, and while giving, at the tip.\n*Paṭicchannakūṭa* means making the balance hollow, putting iron powder inside, and while taking, tilting it to the back side, and while giving, to the front side.\n*Kaṃsa* is called a gold plate; deceiving with that is *kaṃsakūṭa*.\nHow? Making one gold plate, and making two or three other metal plates of golden color, then going to a town, entering some modest family, and saying, \"Buy golden vessels!\" When the price is asked, they are willing to give a higher price.\nThen they say, \"How is the golden quality of these to be known?\" When told, \"Examine and take them,\" after rubbing the gold plate on a stone, he gives all the plates and leaves.\n*Mānakūṭa* is of three kinds based on *hadayabheda*, *sikhābheda*, and *rajjubheda*.\nThere, *hadayabheda* is obtained at the time of measuring ghee, oil, etc.\nWhen taking those, with a measuring container with a hole at the bottom, saying \"Pour slowly!\", after causing much to drip into the inner vessel, he takes it; when giving, closing the hole, quickly filling it, he gives.\n*Sikhābheda* is obtained at the time of measuring sesame, rice, etc.\nWhen taking those, slowly raising the top, he takes it; when giving, quickly filling it, cutting off the top, he gives.\n*Rajjubheda* is obtained at the time of measuring fields and land.\nNot obtaining profit, indeed, they measure the field, making even a small one large.\nAmong *ukkoṭana*, etc., *ukkoṭana* means taking the profit to make the ownerless into the owner.\n*Vañcana* is deceiving others by those various means.\nThere, this is one story: a hunter, having taken a deer and a fawn, is coming; a cheat tells him, \"Sir, what is the price of the deer? What is the price of the fawn?\"\nWhen told, \"The deer is two *kahāpaṇas*, the fawn is one,\" giving one *kahāpaṇa*, having taken the fawn, having gone a little, he returns, \"Sir, I don't need the fawn, give me the deer!\"\nThen [the hunter says]: \"Then give two *kahāpaṇas*!\"\nHe says, \"Sir, didn't I give you one *kahāpaṇa* before?\" \"Yes, you gave it.\"\n\"[Then] take this fawn, and that *kahāpaṇa*, and this fawn worth a *kahāpaṇa*, so there will be two *kahāpaṇas*.\"\nHe, recognizing that he is speaking a reason, having taken the fawn, did not give the deer.\n*Nikati* is deceiving with a likeness, making something unseemly seemly, making something that is not a gem seem like a gem, or making something that is not gold seem like gold, by means of skill or by means of magic.\n*Sāciyoga* is crooked conduct; this itself is the name of *ukkoṭana*, etc.\nTherefore, *ukkoṭanasāciyoga*, *vañcanasāciyoga*, *nikatisāciyoga*—in this way, the meaning should be seen here.\nSome say that showing one thing and exchanging it for another is *sāciyoga*.\nThat, however, is included in deception itself.\nAmong *chedana*, etc., *chedana* is cutting off the hand, etc.\n*Vadha* is killing.\n*Bandha* is binding by means of ropes, etc.\n*Viparāmosa* is of two kinds: *himaviparāmosa* and *gumbaviparāmosa*.\nThat which, at the time of snowfall, being covered by snow, deceive people walking on the path—this is *himaviparāmosa*.\nThat which, being covered by bushes, etc., deceive—this is *gumbaviparāmosa*.\n*Ālopa* is called the act of plundering villages, towns, etc.\n*Sahasākāra* is a violent act.\nHaving entered a house, placing a weapon on the chest of people, taking desired goods.\nThus, the ascetic Gautama refrains from mutilating… robbery… and violence.\n\nOr, bhikkhus, a common person, when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata, might speak thus:",

Now, expanding on the intermediate level of morality, he says, \"Just as some venerable ones...\" and so on.\n\nHerein lies the explanation of terms that are not obvious.\n\n\"Faith-offerings\" means gifts given with conviction in action (karma) and its result (phala), in this world (ihaloka) and the next world (paraloka).\n\nThe meaning is that gifts are not given thinking, \"This is my relative (ñātī),\" or \"my friend (mitto),\" or \"This one will reciprocate,\" or \"This was done by him previously.\"\n\nIndeed, things given in this way are not called faith-offerings (saddhādeyyāni).\n\n\"Foods\" is merely a summary designation, but in reality, faith-offerings include eating foods (bhojanāni bhuñjitvā), wearing robes (cīvarāni pārupitvā), making use of lodgings (senāsanāni sevamānā), and using medicine for the sick (gilānabhesajjaṃ paribhuñjamānā)—all of this is already included in what was said.\n\n\"Seyyathidam\" is a particle (nipāto).\n\nWhat is the meaning of that?

    "commentary_english": "12. \"Accumulation-and-use\" means the use of what has been accumulated.\n\nTherein, there are two kinds of talk: according to the *Vinaya*, and according to self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nFirstly, according to the *Vinaya*, whatever food has been accepted today becomes something to be accumulated if it is kept until the next day; in using it, there is an offense entailing confession (*pācittiya*).\n\nBut having given what was obtained by oneself to novices (*sāmaṇera*) and having had what was obtained by them kept, it is allowable to eat on the second day; but that is not self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nAnd the same rule applies in the case of accumulating drinks.\n\nTherein, \"drink\" means eight drinks beginning with mango juice, and whatever is in accordance with them.\n\nThe decision regarding them has been stated in the *Samantapāsādikā*.\n\nIn the case of accumulating robes, there is accumulation if there is a robe that has not been designated or dispensed with; and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*); this is a roundabout way of speaking.\n\nBut without a roundabout way, one should be content with three robes; having obtained a fourth, it should be given to another.\n\nIf one is not able to give to just anyone, and there is someone whom one wants to give to, and he has gone for instruction or questioning, it should be given as soon as he has arrived; it is not allowable not to give.\n\nBut when a robe is lacking, it is allowable to keep it until the time allowed, expecting that it will be ready.\n\nIf one cannot obtain people who can sew robes using a needle and thread, it is allowable to perform a *Vinaya* transaction and keep it even after that.\n\nIt is not allowable to keep it thinking, \"When this one is worn out, where will I obtain another like it?\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating vehicles, \"vehicle\" means a palanquin (*vayha*), a chariot (*ratha*), a cart (*sakaṭa*), a litter (*sandamānikā*), a palanquin (*sivikā*), a sedan chair (*pāṭaṅkī*); this is not a vehicle for one who has gone forth (as a renunciate).\n\nHowever, footwear (*upāhanā*) is indeed a vehicle for one who has gone forth.\n\nFor one monk, one pair of footwear is for the wilderness, and one is for washing the feet; at most, two pairs of footwear are allowable.\n\nHaving obtained a third, it should be given to another.\n\nIndeed, it is not allowable to keep it thinking, \"When this one is worn out, where will I obtain another?\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating beds, \"bed\" means a cot (*mañca*).\n\nFor one monk, one cot is for indoors, and one is for a daytime resting place; at most, two cots are allowable.\n\nHaving obtained more than that, it should be given to another monk or to the Order; it is not allowable not to give it.\n\nAnd it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating fragrances, fragrances are allowable for a monk when there is an ailment such as itching, scabies, skin disease, etc.\n\nHaving had those fragrances brought, when that disease has subsided, they should be given to others who are sick, or they should be taken to doors, five-finger houses, places of incense, etc.\n\nIt is not allowable to keep them thinking, \"They will be useful when there is disease again\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\n\"Relish\" is to be understood as what has been stated above.\n\nFor example, here a certain monk—thinking, \"It will be useful at such-and-such a time\"—has sesame seeds, husked rice, green grams, *māsa* beans, coconut shells, salt, fish, meat, dried meat, ghee, oil, molasses, pots, etc. brought and keeps them.\n\nIn the rainy season, having had rice gruel (*yāgu*) cooked by novices early in the morning, and having consumed it, he sends a novice, saying, \"Novice, it is difficult to enter the village in the mud and water. Go to such-and-such a family and announce my being in the monastery; bring curd (*dadhi*) etc. from such-and-such a family.\"\n\nEven when the monks say, \"Venerable sir, are you going to enter the village?\", he says, \"It is difficult to enter, friend, the village now.\"\n\nThey go thinking, \"Good, venerable sir, stay here, we will search for alms and bring them.\"\n\nThen that novice, having brought curd (*dadhi*) etc., and having prepared rice and side dishes, offers it; even while he is eating that, attendants send food, and he eats what is liked and liked.\n\nThen monks take alms food (*piṇḍapāta*) and come, and he eats what is liked and liked, even what is for the neck.\n\nIn this way, he spends even four months.\n\nThis is called, \"A monk lives a family life like a tonsured man, not a monastic life (*samaṇajīvika*).\"\n\nSuch an accumulation of relish is what it is called.\n\nHowever, in a monk's dwelling place, it is allowable to keep this much for the sake of thieves who may arrive at the wrong time: one *nāḷi* of husked rice, one lump of molasses, ghee to the amount of one quarter.\n\nFor if they do not obtain even this much means of hospitality, they might even deprive one of life; therefore, if there is not this much, it is also allowable to have it brought and kept.\n\nAnd at a time of discomfort, it is allowable to use oneself whatever is allowable there.\n\nHowever, even for one keeping a lot in an allowable hut, there is no accumulation.\nFurthermore, the *Tathāgata* has nothing set aside, such as a measure of rice grains or anything else, or even a piece of rag that is four spans in size, thinking, \"This will be mine today or tomorrow.\"",
