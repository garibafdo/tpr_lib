    "commentary_english": "378. Thus have I heard…pe… the Jāliya Sutta at Kosambī.\n\nHerein is an explanation of words not previously [encountered].\n\n\"Ghositārāma\" means in the ārāma made by the wealthy man Ghosita.\n\nFormerly, it seems, it was called Allakapparaṭṭha.\n\nThen, a poor man named Kotūhalika, going to the country of Avanti with his wife and children, because of fear of hunger, being unable to carry his son, abandoned him and went on. The mother, turning back, took him and left. They entered a cowherd village.\n\nAnd then much rice-gruel (pāyāsa) was prepared by the cowherd, and they, obtaining the rice-gruel from there, ate it.\n\nThen that man, having eaten a large amount of rice-gruel and being unable to digest it, died during the night and was reborn in that very place in the womb of a bitch, and became a dog. He was dear to the cowherd.\n\nAnd the cowherd attended upon a private Buddha (paccekabuddha).\n\nAnd that private Buddha, at the end of the mealtime, gave the dog a lump [of food] each time, and having aroused affection in the private Buddha, he went to the leaf-hut together with the cowherd.\n\nWhen the cowherd was not present, at mealtime, he himself would go and bark at the leaf-hut door to announce the time [for alms], and even on the road in between, having seen fierce animals, he would bark and drive them away.\n\nHe, with a softened heart toward the private Buddha, at the end of his life, was reborn in the world of the gods.\n\nThere his name was indeed Ghosakadevaputta.\n\nHe, having passed away from the world of the gods, was reborn in Kosambī in the house of a certain family.\n\nThat childless wealthy man, having given wealth to his mother and father, adopted him as his son.\n\nThen, when his own sons were born, he attempted to have him killed seven times.\n\nHe, because of his merit, not attaining death in even seven places, at the end, having his life saved through the cleverness of a certain wealthy man's daughter, in a later part, through the death of his father, having attained the position of a wealthy man, became known as the wealthy man Ghosaka.\n\nAlso, in Kosambī there were two other wealthy men, Kukkuṭaseṭṭhi and Pāvāriyaseṭṭhi; with this one, they were three.\n\nAnd at that time, five hundred ascetics from the Himalayas, for the sake of appeasing their bodies, would come to Kosambī from time to time, and these three wealthy men, having made leaf huts in their own gardens, would attend upon them.\n\nThen one day, those ascetics, coming from the Himalayas, tired and thirsty in the great wilderness, having reached a large banyan tree, sat down there, expecting support from the deity residing there.\n\nThe deity, having extended a hand adorned with all ornaments, gave them drinking water, beverages, etc., and relieved their weariness. These [ascetics], astonished by the power of the deity, asked: \"What good deed, O deity, have you done, by which this success has been obtained by you?\" The deity said: \"In the world a Buddha named the Blessed One has arisen; he now dwells in Sāvatthī, and Anāthapiṇḍika the householder attends upon him.\n\nHe, on the uposatha days, having given only their usual food wages to his servants, has the uposatha observed.\n\nThen one day, at midday, having come for breakfast, I saw some servant not doing any work, and asked: 'Why are people not working today?'\n\nThey announced that matter to me.\n\nThen I said this: 'Now half the day has passed; is it possible to do a half-uposatha?'\n\nThen, having informed the wealthy man, he said, 'It is possible to do it.'\n\nI, having undertaken a half-day, half-uposatha, and having died that very day, have obtained this success.\"\n\nThen those ascetics, \"A Buddha, it seems, has arisen!\" with joy and delight having arisen, though desiring to go to Sāvatthī from there, [thought]: \"These wealthy men who are our supporters have done much for us. We will announce this matter to them also,\" and having gone to Kosambī, after being honored and respected by the wealthy men, they said, \"We will go this very day.\"\n\n\"Why, venerable sirs, are you in such a hurry? Didn't you formerly stay four or five months and then leave?\" And when this was said, they announced that event.\n\n\"Then, venerable sirs, let us go together!\" And when this was said, \"We will go, you come slowly,\" having gone to Sāvatthī, having gone forth in the presence of the Blessed One, they attained arahantship.\n\nThose wealthy men also, with a retinue of five hundred carts each, having gone to Sāvatthī, having given donations, etc., and having requested the Blessed One for the sake of coming to Kosambī, having come back, had three monasteries built.\n\nAmong them, the Kukkuṭārāma was made by Kukkuṭaseṭṭhi, the Pāvārikambavana was made by Pāvāriyaseṭṭhi, the Ghositārāma was made by Ghositaseṭṭhi.\n\nWith reference to that, it was said: \"He dwells in Kosambī, in the Ghositārāma.\"\n\n\"Muṇḍiya\" – this is his name.\n\n\"Jāliya\" – this also is the name of the other.\n\nSince his preceptor wanders for alms with a bowl made of wood, therefore he is called Dārupattikantevāsī.\n\n\"They said this\" means that, desiring to bring forward a dispute with an intention to scold, they said this.\n\nThus, it seems, was their [intention]: \"If the Śramaṇa Gotama says, 'The life is the same as the body,' then we will bring forward this argument against him: 'O Gotama, in your doctrine, the being is destroyed right here, therefore your doctrine is a doctrine of annihilation.'\"\n\n\"If, however, he says, 'The life is one thing, the body is another,' then we will bring forward this argument against him: 'In your doctrine, the form is destroyed, not the being.\n\nTherefore, in your doctrine, the being becomes eternal.'\"\nThen the Blessed One thought, \"These (people) are asking a question for the purpose of introducing a debate. They do not know that in my teaching there is a middle path (*madhyamā pratipadā*) without approaching these two extremes (*dve ante*). Come, having answered their question, I will teach the Dharma (*dharmaṃ deśemi*) for the sake of revealing that very path.\" Having thought this, he said, \"Then, friend,\" and so on.",

    "commentary_english": "1.  There, *evaṃ* is a particle.\n*Meti* and others are nouns.\nIn \"he has undertaken,\" *paṭi-* is a prefix, and *hoti* is a verb.\nIn this way, the division of words should be understood.\nIn meaning, however, the word *evaṃ* has various meanings, such as comparison, instruction, praise, reproach, acceptance of a statement, mode, demonstration, and ascertainment.\nLikewise, it was said, \"Having been born thus, a mortal should do much good\" (Dha.\np.\n53), it comes in comparison and so on.\n\"Thus should you move forward, thus should you move backward\" and so on (A.\nN.\n4.\n122) in instruction.\n\"So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Well-Gone\" and so on (A.\nN.\n3.\n66) in praise.\n\"Thus, in this way, this wretched woman praises that shaven ascetic, whatever or whoever he may be\" and so on (Saṃ.\nN.\n1.\n187) in reproach.\n\"So it is, venerable sir,\" thus those monks replied to the Blessed One and so on (M.\nN.\n1.\n1) in acceptance of a statement.\n\"Thus, indeed, venerable sir, do I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One\" and so on (M.\nN.\n1.\n398) in mode.\n\"Come, young man, go to the *śramaṇa* Ānanda; having gone, ask the *śramaṇa* Ānanda in my name whether he is free from affliction, free from ailment, quickly rising, strong, and living in comfort.\n\"Subha, the young man Todeyyaputta, asks the venerable Ānanda whether he is free from affliction, free from ailment, quickly rising, strong, and living in comfort.\"\n\"And say thus: 'May the venerable Ānanda, out of compassion, come to the dwelling of Subha, the young man Todeyyaputta,'\" and so on (D.\nN.\n1.\n445) in demonstration.\n\"What do you think, O Kālāmas, are these things wholesome *kuśala* or unwholesome *akuśala*?\" \"Unwholesome *akuśala*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Are they blameworthy *sāvajja* or blameless *anavajja*?\" \"Blameworthy *sāvajja*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Are they censured by the wise *viññugarahita* or praised by the wise *viññuppasattha*?\" \"Censured by the wise *viññugarahita*, venerable sir.\"\n\"Being undertaken and put into effect, do they lead to harm and suffering *duḥkha*, or not, or how does it appear to you in this case?\" \"Being undertaken and put into effect, venerable sir, they lead to harm and suffering *duḥkha*; thus it appears to us in this case\" and so on (A.\nN.\n3.66) In the sense of emphasis.\n\nHere, it should be viewed as an instance of mode, illustration and emphasis.\n\nHerein, in the sense of mode, he illustrates this meaning by the word \"thus\". [The meaning is that the Blessed One's word] is skillful in many methods (nānānayanipuṇa), arises from diverse inclinations (anekajjhāsayasamuṭṭhānaṃ), is endowed with meaning and expression (atthabyañjanasampannaṃ), possesses various marvels (vividhapāṭihāriyaṃ), is profound in teaching and penetrating ideas and meanings (dhammatthadesanāpaṭivedhagambhīraṃ), and comes to the ear of all beings (sabbasattānaṃ) in accordance with their own language (sakasakabhāsānurūpato). Who is capable of understanding it in every way (sabbappakārena)? However, by arousing the desire to hear in every way (sabbathāmena), [it is said] 'Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),' and 'I also heard (mayāpi evaṃ suta) in one way (ekena ākārena.'\n\nIn the sense of demonstration, excluding himself by saying, \"I am not self-become (nāhaṃ sayambhū), nor has this been realized by me (na mayā idaṃ sacchikata),\" he demonstrates the entire *sūtra* (sakalaṃ suttaṃ) that is to be spoken now, [saying] \"Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),\" \"I also heard (mayāpi evaṃ suta).\"\n\nIn the sense of emphasis, [it is said,] \"Monks, this Ānanda is foremost among my disciples who are learned (bahussutānaṃ), endowed with *gati*, *sati*, and *dhiti*, and attendants (upaṭṭhākānaṃ),\" (A.N. 1.223).\n\nThus, by the Blessed One: “The venerable Ānanda is skilled in meaning (*arthakusala*), skilled in Dharma (*dharmakusala*), skilled in expression (*byañjanakusala*), skilled in etymology (*niruttikusala*), skilled in what precedes and what follows (*pubbāparakusala*),\" (A.N. 5.169).\n\nThus, the general of the Dharma (dhammasenāpatinā), showing his strength of memory (dhāraṇabalaṃ) in accordance with the commended state (pasatthabhāvānurūpaṃ), generates a desire to hear in beings (sattānaṃ sotukāmataṃ janeti), [saying] \"Thus I heard (evaṃ me sutaṃ),\" and \"That, indeed, is neither less nor more in meaning or expression (atthato vā byañjanato vā anūnamanadhikaṃ), and it should be regarded exactly thus (evameva na aññathā daṭṭhabba).\"\n\nThe word \"me\" (me-saddo) appears in three senses (tīsu atthesu dissati).\n\nThus, in passages such as \"What has been earned by stanzas is uneatable by me (gāthābhigītaṃ me abhojaneyya),\" (S.N. 81) the meaning is \"by me (mayā).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Venerable Sir (bhante), may the Blessed One (bhagavā) teach me the Dharma (dhammaṃ desetū) in brief (saṅkhittena),\" (S.N. 4.88) the meaning is \"to me (mayhaṃ).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Monks (bhikkhave), be my heirs in Dharma (dhammadāyādā me),\" (M.N. 1.29) the meaning is \"of me (mama).\"\n\nHere, however, \"by me heard (mayā sutaṃ)\" and \"my heard (mama sutaṃ)\" are appropriate in two meanings (atthadvaye yujjati).\n\nHere, *suta*, this word *suta*, with and without prefixes (*saupasaggo ca anupasaggo ca*)—[has] various kinds of meanings (anekatthappabhedo), such as going, celebrated, stained, accumulated, application, knowable by the ear, following the ear-door, known, and so forth—thus, in passages such as \"Urging the army (senāya pasuto),\" the meaning is \"going (gacchanto).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Of one who sees the heard Dharma (sutadhammassa passato),\" (Udā. 11) the meaning is \"of the celebrated Dharma (vissutadhammassa).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Flowed out, of one who has flowed out (avassutā avassutassā),\" (Pāci. 657) the meaning is \"of one stained and unstained (kilinnākilinnassa).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Merit has been produced by you, no little (tumhehi puññaṃ pasutaṃ anappaka),\" (Khu. Pā. 7.12) the meaning is \"accumulated (upacitaṃ).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Those steadfast ones intent on *jhāna* (ye jhānapasutā dhīrā),\" (Dha. Pa. 181) the meaning is \"devoted to *jhāna* (*jhānānuyuttā*).\"\n\nIn passages such as \"Seen, heard, sensed (diṭṭhaṃ sutaṃ muta),\" (M.\nni.\n1.\n2.  241) *sotaviññeyyanti attho*: the meaning is, cognizable by the ear.\n‘‘*sutadharo sutasannicayo*’’*tiādīsu* (ma.: in such passages as 'he remembers what he has heard, stores up what he has heard' (etc.).\nni.\n1.\n2.  339) *sotadvārānusāraviññātadharoti attho*: the meaning is, one who bears in mind what is cognized in the ear-door.\n*idha panassa sotadvārānusārena upadhāritanti vā upadhāraṇanti vāti attho*: But here the meaning of *sutam* is properly ‘what has been recorded by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness’, or it is the ‘act of recording’.\n*‘me’ saddassa hi ‘mayā’ti atthe sati ‘evaṃ mayā sutaṃ’ sotadvārānusārena upadhāritanti yujjati*: ‘me’ means ‘by me’; thus when there is the meaning of ‘by me’, it is fitting [to say] ‘*evaṃ mayā sutaṃ*’ what has been recorded by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness.\n*‘mamā’ti atthe sati evaṃ mama sutaṃ sotadvārānusārena upadhāraṇanti yujjati*: ‘mine’ means when there is the meaning of ‘mine,’ thus ‘*evaṃ mama sutaṃ*’ is fitting as the act of recording by a given series of consciousnesses ushered in by ear-consciousness.\n*evametesu tīsu padesu evanti sotaviññāṇādiviññāṇakiccanidassanaṃ*: So as regards these three words, *evam* is the demonstration of consciousness’s function as ear-consciousness, etc.\n*meti vuttaviññāṇasamaṅgipuggalanidassanaṃ*: and *me* demonstrates a person connected with the described consciousness.\n*sutanti assavanabhāvapaṭikkhepato anūnādhikāviparītaggahaṇanidassanaṃ*: while *sutam* is a demonstration of grasping what is neither deficient nor excessive nor distorted, because it rejects the state of non-hearing.\n*tathā evanti tassā sotadvārānusārena pavattāya viññāṇavīthiyā nānappakārena ārammaṇe pavattibhāvappakāsanaṃ*: Similarly, *evam* demonstrates that the kinds of cognizance beginning with hearing have actually occurred in the various ways with respect to an object by the description of the modes of the cognitive series 17 that has occurred by means of the ear-consciousness.\n*meti attappakāsanaṃ*: *me* demonstrates an individual self.\n*sutanti dhammappakāsanaṃ*: and *sutam* demonstrates an idea.\n*ayañhettha saṅkhepo – ‘‘nānappakārena ārammaṇe pavattāya viññāṇavīthiyā mayā na aññaṃ kataṃ, idaṃ pana kataṃ, ayaṃ dhammo suto’’ti*: Herein this is the summary: “Nothing else was done by me with the cognitive series that has occurred in the various ways with respect to an object; but this was done; this idea was cognized.”\n*tathā evanti niddisitabbadhammappakāsanaṃ*: Similarly, *evam* demonstrates something about to be demonstrated.\n*meti puggalappakāsanaṃ*: *me* demonstrates a person.\n*sutanti puggalakiccappakāsanaṃ*: and *sutam* demonstrates the person’s function.\n*idaṃ vuttaṃ hoti*: This is what is said:\n*‘‘yaṃ suttaṃ niddisissāmi, taṃ mayā evaṃ suta’’nti*: “That *sūtra* which I will indicate, that was thus heard by me”.\n*tathā evanti yassa cittasantānassa nānākārappavattiyā nānatthabyañjanaggahaṇaṃ hoti, tassa nānākāraniddeso*: Similarly, *evam* is the various demonstration of one whose mind-continuum has a grasp of various meanings and expressions from the occurrence of various modes.\n*evanti hi ayamākārapaññatti*: *evam* is indeed the description of this mode.\n*meti kattuniddeso*: *me* demonstrates an agent.\n*sutanti visayaniddeso*: *sutam* demonstrates an object.\n*ettāvatā nānākārappavattena cittasantānena taṃ samaṅgino kattu visayaggahaṇasanniṭṭhānaṃ kataṃ hoti*: To this extent, by the mind-continuum that occurs in various modes, the establishment of the agent's grasp of the object is done by him who is connected with it.\n*athavā evanti puggalakiccaniddeso*: Or, *evam* demonstrates a person’s function.\n*sutanti viññāṇakiccaniddeso*: *sutam* demonstrates consciousness’s function.\n*meti ubhayakiccayuttapuggalaniddeso*: and *me* demonstrates a person connected with both these functions.\n*ayaṃ panettha saṅkhepo, ‘‘mayā savanakiccaviññāṇasamaṅginā puggalena viññāṇavasena laddhasavanakiccavohārena suta’’nti*: Herein, this is the summary, “By me, a person connected with consciousness functioning as hearing, by means of consciousness, by a term for a function of acquired hearing, [it was] cognized”.\n*tattha evanti ca meti ca saccikaṭṭhaparamatthavasena avijjamānapaññatti*: Herein, the words *evam* and *me* are, in the true sense and ultimate sense, a description in terms of the non- factual.\n*kiñhettha taṃ paramatthato atthi, yaṃ evanti vā meti vā niddesaṃ labhetha? sutanti vijjamānapaññatti*: What, herein, exists in the ultimate sense, that could obtain a demonstration such as *evam* or *me*? while *sutam* is a description in terms of the factual.\n*yañhi taṃ ettha sotena upaladdhaṃ, taṃ paramatthato vijjamānanti*: Because, indeed, that which is perceived here by the ear is, in the ultimate sense, factual.\n*tathā ‘eva’nti ca, meti ca, taṃ taṃ upādāya vත්තබ්ବతో upādāpaññatti*: Similarly, *evam* and *me* are a derivative description because they are stated derivatively upon this or that fact.\n*‘suta’nti diṭṭhādīni upanidhāya vत्तබ්බతో upanidhāpaññatti*: while *sutam* is an appositional description because it that is, the heard, is so called in apposition to the seen and the rest.\n*ettha ca evanti vacanena asammohaṃ dīpeti*: Here too, by the word *evam* he points out non-confusion.\n*na hi sammūḷho nānappakārapaṭivedhasamattho hoti*: For someone who is confused is not capable of penetration of difference in kind.\n*‘suta’nti vacanena sutassa asammosaṃ dīpeti*: By the word *sutam* he points out non-forgetting of what was heard.\n*yassa hi sutaṃ sammuṭṭhaṃ hoti, na so kālantarena mayā sutanti paṭijānāti*: Because, someone whose hearing is forgotten, does not acknowledge after a time has elapsed: ‘I heard [this]’.\nThrough non-confusion, there is accomplishment of wisdom (*paññā-siddhi*); however, through non-forgetfulness, there is accomplishment of mindfulness (*sati-siddhi*).\n\nThere, with mindfulness preceded by wisdom, there is the ability to ascertain the letters (*byañjanāvadhāraṇa-samatthatā*); with wisdom preceded by mindfulness, there is the ability to penetrate the meaning (*attha-paṭivedha-samatthatā*).\n\nThrough the power of both these abilities, there is accomplishment of being a custodian of the *dharma*-treasure (*dharma-bhāṇḍāgārika-tta-siddhi*), due to the ability to preserve the *dharma*-treasury (*dharma-kośa*) which is endowed with meaning and letters (*attha-byañjana-sampannassa*).\n\nAnother way: by the word *evaṃ*, he indicates reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāraṃ dīpeti*).\n\nIndeed, because of the absence of various kinds of penetration, [that comes] from not giving reasoned attention (*ayoniso manasi-karoto hi nānappakāra-paṭivedhābhāvato*).\n\nBy the word *sutaṃ*, he indicates non-distraction (*avikkhepaṃ dīpeti*), because hearing is absent in one whose mind is distracted (*vikkhitta-cittassa savanābhāvato*).\n\nFor example, a distracted person, even when being told everything, says, \"I did not hear it; say it again.\"\n\nAnd through reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikārena*), here he establishes right self-direction (*attasammāpaṇidhiṃ*) and previously performed merit (*katapuññataṃ*), because of the absence of that (*tadabhāvato*) in one who is wrongly directed (*sammā appaṇihita-attassa*) and has not performed merit previously (*akatapuññassa vā*).\n\nThrough non-distraction (*avikkhepena*), he establishes hearing the true *dharma* (*saddhammassavanaṃ*) and reliance on true men (*sappurisūpanissayañca*).\n\nFor a distracted person is not able to hear, nor is there hearing for one who does not attend upon true men.\n\nAnother way: because by *evaṃ*, the grasping of various meanings and letters (*nānā-attha-byañjana-ggahaṇaṃ*) occurs to the mind-stream (*citta-santānassa*) with various kinds of activity (*nānākāra-ppavattiyā*), therefore it is said to be a designation of various kinds (*nānākāra-niddeso*). But that good form (*bhaddako ākāro*) does not occur for one who is wrongly directed (*sammā appaṇihita-attano*) and has not previously performed merit (*akatapuññassa vā*); therefore by this good form (*iminā bhaddakenākārena*) he indicates the attainment of the two subsequent wheels (*pacchimacakka-dvaya-sampattiṃ*).\n\n*Sutaṃ* [indicates] the attainment of the two prior wheels (*purimacakkadvayasampattiṃ*) through the practice of hearing (*savana-yogena*).\n\nIndeed, there is no hearing (*savanaṃ natthi*) for one dwelling in an unsuitable place (*appatirūpa-dese vasato*) or who is without reliance on true men (*sappurisūpanissaya-virahitassa vā*).\n\nThrough the accomplishment of the two subsequent wheels (*pacchima-cakka-dvaya-siddhiyā*), there is the accomplishment of purity of intention (*āśaya-śuddhi-siddhā hoti*); through the accomplishment of the two prior wheels (*purima-cakka-dvaya-siddhiyā*), there is purity of practice (*prayoga-śuddhi*). And through that purity of intention (*tāya ca āśaya-śuddhiyā*), there is accomplishment of manifest realization (*adhigama-byatti-siddhi*); through purity of practice (*prayoga-śuddhiyā*), there is accomplishment of manifest tradition (*āgama-byatti-siddhi*).\n\nThus, the speech (*vacanaṃ*) of one whose practice and intention are pure (*payoga-āśaya-śuddhasa*) and who is endowed with tradition and realization (*āgama-adhigama-sampannassa*), like the first light of dawn (*aruṇuggaṃ viya*) from the rising of the sun (*sūriyassa udayato*), and like reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāro viya ca*) to wholesome action (*kuśala-kammassa*), he establishes the cause (*nidānaṃ ṭhapento*) in a suitable place (*ṭhāne*), [saying]: \"*Evaṃ me sutaṃ* – Thus have I heard.\" He said, beginning with that, that it is fitting to precede the word of the Blessed One (*arhati bhagavato vacanassa pubbaṅgamaṃ bhavituṃ*).\n\nAnother way: by the word *evaṃ*, with this word that illuminates various kinds of penetration (*iminā nānāppakāra-paṭivedha-dīpakena vacanena*), he indicates the complete presence of his own skillful understanding of meaning and analytical insight (*attano attha-paṭibhāna-paṭisambhidā-sampatti-sabbhāvaṃ dīpeti*).\n\n*Sutaṃ* [indicates] the complete presence of analytical insight and skillful expression of *dharma* in a way that illuminates the divisions of what is to be heard (*sotabba-ppabheda-paṭivedha-dīpakena dhamma-nirutti-paṭisambhidā-sampatti-sabbhāvaṃ*).\n\nAnd *evaṃ*—illuminating reasoned attention (*yoniso manasikāra-dīpakaṃ*)—uttering the word *idaṃ*, he indicates: \"These *dharmas* have been considered by me in my mind, [and] are well-penetrated by insight\" (*ete mayā dhammā manasānupekkhitā, diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā*).\n\n*Sutaṃ*—illuminating the practice of hearing (*savana-yoga-dīpakaṃ*)—uttering the word *idaṃ*, he indicates: \"Many *dharmas* have been heard by me, retained, [and] consolidated by word\" (*bahū mayā dhammā sutā dhātā vacasā paricitā*).\n\nBy both of these, showing the completeness of meaning and letter (*attha-byañjana-pāripūriṃ dīpento*), he generates reverence in hearing (*savane ādaraṃ janeti*).\n\nFor indeed, one who does not respectfully listen to the *dharma* that is complete in meaning and letter (*attha-byañjana-paripuṇṇaṃ hi dhammaṃ ādarena assuṇanto*) is excluded from great benefit (*mahatā hitā paribāhiro hoti*); therefore, generating reverence (*ādaraṃ janetvā*), this *dharma* should be heard carefully (*sakkaccaṃ ayaṃ dhammo sotabbo*).\n\n\"Thus I have heard (*evaṃ me sutaṃ*)\"—by this entire utterance (*iminā pana sakalena vacanena*), the venerable Ānanda, not appropriating to himself the *dharma* proclaimed by the *Tathāgata* (*tathāgata-ppaveditaṃ dhammaṃ attano adahanto*), transcends the plane of those who are not true men (*asappurisa-bhūmiṃ atikkamati*).\n\nAcknowledging discipleship (*sāvakattaṃ paṭijānanto*), he descends to the plane of true men (*sappurisa-bhūmiṃ okkamati*).\n\nThus, he has his mind emerge from what is not the true *dharma* (*asaddhammā cittaṃ vuṭṭhāpeti*), [and] he establishes his mind in the true *dharma* (*saddhamme cittaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti*).\n\n\"All this has been heard by me, [and] is the word of the Blessed One\" (*kevalaṃ sutam-ev-etaṃ mayā, tassa-eva bhagavato vacanaṃ*)—showing this (*dīpento*), he frees himself (*attānaṃ parimoceti*), he bears witness to the Teacher (*satthāraṃ apadisati*), he applies the Victor's word (*jinavacanaṃ appeti*), [and] he establishes the guide of the *dharma* (*dhamma-nettiṃ patiṭṭhāpeti*).\n\nMoreover, \"Thus I have heard (*evaṃ me sutaṃ*)\"—not claiming it to be produced by himself (*attanā uppāditabhāvaṃ appaṭijānanto*), clarifying the prior utterance (*purimaṃ vacanaṃ vivaranto*)—\"This has been received by me directly (*sammukhā paṭiggahitam idaṃ mayā*) from that Blessed One who is confident in the four grounds for confidence (*catu-vesārajja-visāradassa*), the possessor of the ten powers (*dasa-bala-dharassa*), abiding in the place of a bull (*āsabha-ṭṭhāna-ṭṭhāyino*), with the sound of a lion's roar and so forth (*sīhanāda-nādino*), the best of all beings (*sabba-sattu-ttamassa*), the lord of the *dharma* (*dhamm-issarassa*), the king of the *dharma* (*dhamma-rājassa*), the master of the *dharma* (*dhammādhipatino*), the lamp of the *dharma* (*dhamma-dīpassa*), the refuge of the *dharma* (*dhamma-saraṇassa*), the best wheel-turner of the true *dharma* (*saddhamma-vara-cakka-vattino*), the perfectly awakened one (*sammā-sambuddhassa vacanaṃ*)—\"Here, there should not be doubt or uncertainty (*na ettha atthe vā dhamme vā pade vā byañjane vā kaṅkhā vā vimati vā kātabbā*).\" He destroys the lack of faith in this *dharma* in all gods and humans (*sabbesaṃ deva-manussānaṃ imasmiṃ dhamme assaddhiyaṃ vināseti*), [and] he generates the accomplishment of faith (*saddhā-sampadaṃ uppādeti*).\n\nTherefore this is said: *ekaṃ*—a designation that is a reckoning and a demarcation (*gaṇana-pariccheda-niddeso*).\n\n*Samayanti*—a demarcated designation (*paricchinna-niddeso*).\n\n*Ekaṃ samayanti*—an indefinite illumination (*aniyamita-paridīpanaṃ*).\n\nThere, the word *samaya*—thus his—\"Perhaps we may approach him again tomorrow, taking time and occasion into consideration (*appeva-nāma svepi upasaṅkameyyāma kālañca samayañca upādāya*)”\" (D.\nN.\n1.\n447) is the meaning of combination (*samavāyo attho*).\n\n\"There is only one moment and occasion, *bhikkhus*, for living the holy life (*ekova kho bhikkhave, khaṇo ca samayo ca brahmacariya-vāsāyā*)\" (A.\nN.\n8.\n29) [is] the moment (*khaṇo*).\n\n\"*Uṇha-samayo pariḷāha-samayo*—It is the hot season, it is the burning season\" (Pāci.\n358) [is] time (*kālo*).\n\n\"*Mahāsamayo pavanasmi*—A great occasion in the forest\" (D.\nNi.\n2.\n332) A collection.\n\"Also, Bhaddali, this circumstance was not recognised by you: 'The Blessed One is living at Sāvatthi, and the Blessed One will know me thus: \"The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.\"'\nThis circumstance too, Bhaddali, was not recognised by you\" and so forth (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n135) A cause.\n\"Now on that occasion the Wanderer Samanama-ndikaputta was staying in Mallika’s Single-hall Tinduka-tree-plantation Park for Debating Opinions\" and so forth (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n260) A view.\nThere, although in these occasions beginning with year, whatever sutta was spoken in whichever year, season, month, fortnight, night or day, all that is well-known and well-established in wisdom to the Elder.\nBecause, however – \"Thus I have heard\" in such-and-such year, in such-and-such season, in such-and-such month, in such-and-such fortnight, in such-and-such part of the night, in such-and-such part of the day – when it is said thus, it is not possible to retain it easily or to recite it, or to have it recited, and much has to be said, therefore having summarized that meaning in one word, he said \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nOr else what is meant is: among the Blessed One’s several times specially evident to gods and men and counted as Occasions, such as the Occasion of the Conception in the Womb ( *gabbhokkantisamaya* ), Occasion of the Birth ( *jātisamaya* ), Occasion of the Sense of Urgency ( *saṃvegasamaya* ), Occasion of the Renunciation ( *abhinikkhamanasamaya* ), Occasion of the Austerities ( *dukkarakārikāsamaya* ), Occasion of the Conquest of Māra ( *māravijayasamaya* ), Occasion of the Enlightenment ( *abhisambodhisamaya* ), Occasion of the Pleasant Abiding Here and Now ( *diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārasamaya* ), Occasion of the Teaching ( *desanāsamaya* ), Occasion of the Final Extinction ( *parinibbānasamaya* ).\nAmong these occasions, he indicates that the Occasion of Teaching ( *desanāsamaya* ) is called \"one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nAnd that occasion of compassionate action among occasions of knowledge and compassionate action, the occasion of practice beneficial to others among occasions of practice beneficial to oneself and to others, the occasion of Dhamma talk among occasions of two duties that should be done by those assembled, the occasion of teaching among occasions of practice of teaching, also with reference to those occasions, he said \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ).\nWhy is the accusative case used here, as in the Abhidhamma, \"when the realm of desire\" ( *yasmiṃ samaye kāmāvacaraṃ* ) (Dha.\nSa.\n1) and, in other Sutta passages, \"when, monks, a monk is secluded from desires\" ( *yasmiṃ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi* ) is the locative case used, and in the Vinaya, \"at that time the Buddha, the Blessed One\" ( *tena samayena buddho bhagavā* ) is the instrumental case used, and not having done so, why is the accusative case \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) used? There, it is so because the meaning is possible in different ways here and there.\nFor there, in the Abhidhamma and in other Sutta passages, the meaning of the locative case as a container and the meaning of characterization of one substantive by another substantive are possible.\nNow the locative case is the time, and the Occasion is a collection; there, the nature of those things beginning with contact, which are stated there, is characterized by the nature of the Occasion, which is called a moment, an event, and a cause, therefore the locative case is used there to illuminate that meaning.\nAnd in the Vinaya, the meaning of the instrumental case is that of cause and reason.\nFor that Occasion of the proclamation of the training precept, which is difficult to know even for Sāriputta and others, the Blessed One, making known the training precepts on that occasion, which was the cause and the reason, and expecting the cause of the proclamation of the training precept, dwelt there and there, therefore the instrumental case is used there to illuminate that meaning.\nHere, however, and in other similar passages, the meaning of direct governance is possible.\nFor when the Blessed One taught this or any other Sutta, he dwelt on that occasion entirely in an abode of compassion, therefore the accusative case is used here to illuminate that meaning.\nTherefore, it is said thus: But the ancients explain it, \"At that time\" ( *tasmiṃ samaye* ) or, \"By that time\" ( *tena samayena* ) or, \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ), this is merely a difference in expression, the meaning is the same everywhere.\nTherefore, even when \"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) is said, the meaning should be understood as \"At one occasion\" ( *ekasmiṃ samaye* ).\n*Bhagavā* is revered.\nFor in the world, they call the *Bhagavā* revered.\nAnd this one is revered by all beings because of being distinguished by all qualities, therefore he should be understood as the *Bhagavā*.\nIt has also been said by the ancients – and also – the meaning of the expansion of the meaning of the word according to this verse should be understood.\nAnd that has already been said in the section on recollection of the Buddha in the *Visuddhimagga*.\nThus far, by the words \"Thus I have heard\" here, showing the Dhamma as it was heard, he makes the *Dhammakāya* of the Blessed One manifest.\nTherefore, by the Teacher's not being seen, he consoles the people who are longing [for him], [saying] \"This is not a teaching with a passed-away teacher, this is your Teacher\" ( *ayaṃ vo satthā* ).\nBy the words \"On one occasion the Blessed One\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā* ), showing the non-existence of the Blessed One at that time, he establishes the *parinibbāna* of the *rūpakāya*.\nTherefore, \"Such a one, the teacher of the noble Dhamma, the possessor of the ten powers, whose body is like a mass of diamonds, even that Blessed One has attained *parinibbāna*, by what other should hope be generated in life?\" Thus he stirs up the people who are intoxicated with the pride of life, and he generates enthusiasm in them for the true Dhamma.\nAnd saying \"Thus\" ( *evaṃ* ), he indicates the accomplishment of the teaching ( *desanāsampattiṃ* ).\n\"Thus I have heard\" ( *me sutaṃ* ) is the accomplishment of a listener ( *sāvakasampattiṃ* ).\n\"On one occasion\" ( *ekaṃ samayaṃ* ) is the accomplishment of time ( *kālasampattiṃ* ).\nand by the words “the Exalted One,” that it possesses a teacher.\nAnd between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda, the word *antarā* appears in the meanings of cause, moment, mind, middle, interval, and so on.\n\"Who would know that interval apart from the *Tathāgatas*?\" (A.\nNipāta 6.\n44) and, \"When people meet and discuss, what is the interval between you and me?\" (Saṃyutta Nikāya 1.\n228) and so on, the word *antarā* is [used] in the sense of cause.\n\"A certain woman saw me by a flash of lightning, O Blessed One, washing a pot\" etc. (Majjhima Nikāya 2.\n149) [is used in the sense of] moment.\n\"For whom there is no anger within\" etc. (Udāna 20) [is used in the sense of] mind (*citta*).\n\"The end came in between\" etc. (Cūḷavagga 350) [is used in the sense of] middle (*vemajjhe*).\n\"But the Tapodā runs between two great hells, monks\" etc. (Pārājika 231) [is used in the sense of] interval (*vivare*).\nNow, it exists in this interval, therefore, the interval between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda, thus the meaning here should be understood.\nBecause it is associated with the word *antarā*, the expression \"upayoga\" is made.\nAnd in such places, those who contemplate letters use only one word *antarā* \"he goes between the village and the river\" thus, that should be connected even with the second word. If it is not connected, the expression \"upayoga\" is not obtained.\nHere, however, it is said having connected [the words].\n*Addhānamaggappaṭipanno hoti* means he has undertaken a path known as *addhāna*, the meaning is \"a long path\".\nIn the analysis of the time of going on a long journey, \"I will go half a *yojana*, therefore food should be eaten\" etc. (Pācittiya 218) even half a *yojana* is a long journey.\nNow, from Rājagaha to Nāḷanda is only one *yojana*.\nWith a great monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghena*), 'great' means great by the greatness of virtue (*guṇamahattena*), and great by the greatness of number (*saṅkhyāmahattena*).\nThat monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅgho*) was great also by virtue (*guṇehipi*), because of being endowed with qualities such as fewness of wishes (*appicchatādiguṇasamannāgatattā*).\nIt was also great in number (*saṅkhyāyapi mahā*), being numbered at five hundred (*pañcasatasaṅkhyattā*).\nThe *saṅgha* of *bhikkhus* is the *bhikkhusaṅgho*; by that *bhikkhusaṅghena*.\nThe meaning is a community of ascetics (*samaṇagaṇena*) designated by agreement in views and moral conduct (*diṭṭhisīlasāmaññasaṅghātasaṅkhātena*).\nThe meaning of *saddhinti* is together (*ekato*).\nBy five *matta* hundreds of monks (*bhikkhusatehīti*) means those are five *matta*, therefore they are five *mattas*.\n*Mattā* means *pamāṇa* is said; therefore, just as when it is said \"knowing the measure in food\" (*bhojane mattaññū*), the meaning is \"he knows the measure in food, he knows the *pamāṇa*\", thus here also – \"those five *matta* hundreds of monks are five *pamāṇas*\", thus the meaning should be seen.\nHundreds of monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ satāni*) are monk hundreds (*bhikkhusatāni*), by those five *matta* hundreds of monks (*pañcamattehi bhikkhusatehi*).\n*Suppiyopikho paribbājakoti* means Suppiya is his name.\nThe particle *pi-* has the meaning of combining persons due to being in the same state of having undertaken the path (*maggappaṭipannasabhāgatāya puggalasampiṇḍanattho*).\nThe particle *kho-* makes a connection between words (*padasandhikaro*), [it is] said because of the ease of consonants (*byañjanasiliṭṭhatāvasena vutto*).\n*Paribbājako* means an inhabitant of Sañjaya (*sañjayassa antevāsī*) [is] a wanderer covered [by clothes] (*channaparibbājako*).\nThus it is said: \"When the Blessed One set out on that long road ( *addhānamagga*), then Suppiya the wanderer also set out.\"\nHere, the word *hoti* indicates the past tense.\n*Saddhiṃ antevāsinā brahmadattena māṇavenāti* - *antevāsī* means one who dwells near.\nThe meaning is: a disciple is one who is in close association, who frequents the vicinity.\n*Brahmadatta* is his name.\n*Māṇava* can refer to a noble, a thief, or a youth.\nThere, that is, on that long road, or among those two people.\n*Sudanti* is merely a particle.\n*Anekapariyāyenāti* - the word *pariyāya* occurs in the senses of turn, teaching, and reason (*vāradesanākāraṇesu*).\n\"Whose turn is it today, Ānanda, to advise the nuns?\" and so on.\nni.\n3.\n398) Indeed, the word *pariyāya* functions as a turn.\n\"Bear it in mind as the honey-cake instruction\" and so on.\nni.\n1.\n205) in the teaching.\n\"In this way too, Prince, may it be for a reason\" and so on.\nni.\n2.\n411) in the cause.\nHere too, it functions as cause (*kāraṇe*). Therefore, this is the meaning here: \"By various causes\", \"By many causes\" is said.\n*Buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsatīti* - of the Blessed Buddha, who is without fault and endowed with immeasurable virtues: \"The proper duty towards the elders by birth, such as salutation and respect, is called 'the taste of concord'. The ascetic Gotama does not have this, therefore, the ascetic Gotama is without taste, worthless, an inactionist (*akiriyavādo*), an annihilationist (*ucchedavādo*), disgusting, a trainer, an ascetic, and arrogant.\n\nThe ascetic Gotama has attained no state transcending the merely human level ( *uttarimanussadhamma*), no distinguished knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones (*ariya-ñāṇa-dassana-viseso*).\nThe ascetic Gotama teaches a *dhamma* merely hammered out by reasoning ( *takkapariyāhataṃ*), following his own line of inquiry ( *vīmaṃsānucaritaṃ*), as it occurs to him (*sayaṃpaṭibhānaṃ*).\nThe ascetic Gotama is not omniscient (*sabbaññū*), not a knower of the worlds (*lokavidū*), not supreme (*anuttaro*), not the foremost individual (*aggapuggalo*)\".\nThus, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇanti vatvā*), he speaks again and again with disparagement (*avaṇṇaṃ*), fault (*dosaṃ*), and censure (*nindaṃ*).\nJust as he spoke against the Buddha, so too against the *dhamma*, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇato vatvā*) - \"The ascetic Gotama's *dhamma* is wrongly expounded (*durakkhāto*), wrongly penetrated (*duppaṭivedito*), not liberating (*aniyyāniko*), not conducive to peace (*anupasamasaṃvattaniko*)\" - thus, again and again, he speaks disparagingly.\nJust as regarding the *dhamma*, so too regarding the *saṅgha*, having said that the causeless is itself the cause (*akāraṇameva kāraṇato vatvā*) - \"The ascetic Gotama's community of disciples (*sāvakasaṅgho*) is practicing wrongly (*micchāpaṭipanno*), perversely (*kuṭilapaṭipanno*), has entered upon a warped (*paccanīkapaṭipadaṃ*), distorted (*ananulomapaṭipadaṃ*), unrighteous (*adhammānulomapaṭipadaṃ*) course of practice\" - thus, again and again, he speaks disparagingly.\nHis pupil, however, [said]: \"Our teacher touches what should not be touched, approaches what should not be approached; like one swallowing fire, like one touching the sharp edge of a sword with his hand, like one wanting to split Mount Meru with his fist, like one playing in a row of saw-like teeth, like one seizing a rutting, fierce elephant with his hand, so he, speaking ill of the Triple Gem (*ratanattaya*) worthy of praise, will incur misfortune and ruin.\nIf the teacher were to tread upon dung, fire, thorns, or a black snake, or to mount a stake, eat deadly poison, step into a violent stream, or throw himself down a cliff, there is no reason for the pupil to follow suit.\nFor beings are the owners of their *kamma* and they each go their own way according to their own *kamma*.\nThe father does not inherit the son’s *kamma*, nor the son the father’s; the mother does not inherit the son’s *kamma*, nor the son the mother’s; the brother does not inherit the sister’s *kamma*, nor the sister the brother’s; the teacher does not inherit the pupil’s *kamma*, nor the pupil the teacher’s.\nMy teacher speaks in dispraise of the Triple Gem (*tiṇṇaṃ ratanānaṃ*); this is a terrible blameworthy deed—the reviling of the *ariyas*.\"\nEmerging from such wise reflections, since he was a naturally intelligent young man, he began to speak in many ways in praise of the Triple Gem (*tiṇṇaṃ ratanānaṃ*), confuting his teacher’s views and supporting himself with cogent reasons.\nThus it was said: \"Suppiya's pupil, Brahmadatta, speaks in various ways in praise of the Buddha, the *Dhamma*, and the *Sangha*.\"\nThere, the word *vaṇṇa* appears in the senses of shape (*saṇṭhāna*), birth (*jāti*), form (*rūpa*), sense-sphere (*āyatana*), cause (*kāraṇa*), measure (*pamāṇa*), quality (*guṇa*), praise (*pasaṃsā*), etc.\nThere, \"Having created a large serpent king's appearance\" and so on.\nni.\n1.\n142) *Saṇṭhānaṃ* is said.\n\"Brahmins are the highest caste (*vaṇṇa*), those of any other *vaṇṇa* are inferior,\" etc. (Ma.\nNi.\n2.\n402) *Jāti* (birth, lineage).\n\"Endowed with the utmost beauty of complexion (*vaṇṇapokkharatā*),\" etc. (Dī.\nNi.\n1.\n303) *Rūpāyatanaṃ* (the form sense-sphere).\nThus, these two were pupils of the teacher; thus, these two are pupils of the teacher.\n*Aññamaññassāti añño aññassa*: \"one another\" means one for another.\n*Ujuvipaccanīkavādāti*: *īsakampi apariharitvā ujumeva vividhapaccanīkavādā, anekavāraṃ viruddhavādā eva hutvāti  attho*: meaning that without abandoning even a little, directly [they are] those with diverse opposing views, having many times contradictory views.\nBecause when dispraise (*avaṇṇe*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*) is spoken by the teacher (*ācariyena*), the pupil (*antevāsī*) speaks praise (*vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati*); again, the other [speaks] dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ*), the other [speaks] praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) - thus, the teacher, as if hammering a crooked peg (*visarukkhaāṇiṃ*) on a strong board (*sāraphalake*), repeatedly speaks dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*).\nBut the pupil (*antevāsī*), as if warding off that peg (*taṃ āṇiṃ*) with a peg (*āṇiyā*) made of gold, silver, and jewels (*suvaṇṇarajatamaṇimayāya*), repeatedly speaks praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*).\nTherefore, it was said: \"*Ujuvipaccanīkavādā*.\"\nThey followed (*anubandhā honti*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*) closely (*piṭṭhito piṭṭhito*) and the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghañcāti*); not abandoning (*avijahantā*) the sight (*dassanaṃ*) of the Blessed One (*bhagavantañca*) and the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghañca*) from behind (*pacchato pacchato*), they followed (*anubandhā honti*) with continued deportment (*iriyāpathānubandhanena*), meaning they went (*anugatā hontīti*) having become those who looked after their heads (*sīsānulokino*).\nWhy did the Blessed One (*bhagavā*) set out (*paṭipanno*) on that road (*taṃ addhānaṃ*)? And why did Suppiya (*suppiyo*) follow (*anubandho*)? And why did he (*so*) speak dispraise (*avaṇṇaṃ bhāsatīti*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattayassa*)? At that time (*tasmiṃ kāle*), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), having dwelt (*vasitvā*) in one (*aññatarasmiṃ*) of the eighteen great monasteries (*aṭṭhārasasu mahāvihāresu*) in the vicinity of Rājagaha (*rājagahaparivattakesu*), early in the morning (*pātova*) having restored his body (*sarīrappaṭijagganaṃ katvā*) and at the time for the alms round (*bhikkhācāravelāyaṃ*), surrounded by the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghaparivuto*), wanders (*carati*) for alms (*piṇḍāya*) in Rājagaha (*rājagaha*).\nHaving made (*katvā*) an easily obtained alms-meal (*sulabhapiṇḍapātaṃ*) for the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghassa*) on that day (*taṃ divasaṃ*), after the meal (*pacchābhattaṃ*) having returned from the alms round (*piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto*), having made (*gāhāpetvā*) the monastic community (*bhikkhusaṅghaṃ*) bring his bowl and robe (*pattacīvaraṃ*) — \"I will go (*gamissāmi*) to Nāḷanda (*nāḷandaṃ*),\" he said (*iti*), having left (*nikkhamitvā*) Rājagaha (*rājagahato*) he set out (*paṭipanno*) on that road (*taṃ addhānaṃ*).\nAlso, Suppiya (*suppiyopi*), at that time (*tasmiṃ kāle*), having dwelt (*vasitvā*) in one (*aññatarasmiṃ*) of the monasteries (*ārāme*) for wanderers (*paribbājakā*) in the vicinity of Rājagaha (*rājagahaparivattake*), surrounded by wanderers (*paribbājakaparivuto*), wanders (*carati*) for alms (*bhikkhāya*) in Rājagaha (*rājagahe*).\nHe too (*sopi*), having made (*katvā*) an easily obtained alms-meal (*sulabhabhikkhaṃ*) for the wanderers' assembly (*paribbājakaparisāya*) on that day (*taṃ divasaṃ*), having finished his morning meal (*bhuttapātarāso*), having made (*gāhāpetvā*) the wanderers (*paribbājake*) bring his set of wanderer's requisites (*paribbājakaparikkhāraṃ*) - \"I will go (*gamissāmi*) to Nāḷanda (*nāḷandaṃ*),\" he said (*icceva*), not knowing (*ajānantova*) that the Blessed One (*bhagavato*) had set out (*paṭipannabhāvaṃ*) on that road (*taṃ maggaṃ*), he followed (*anubandho*).\nIf he had known (*jāneyya*), he would not have followed (*nānubandheyya*).\nHe, going along (*gacchanto*) unknowingly (*ajānitvāva*), having lifted his neck (*gīvaṃ ukkhipitvā*), looking around (*olokayamāno*), saw (*addasa*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*) shining (*sobhamānaṃ*) with the glory of a Buddha (*buddhasiriyā*), like the shimmering crest (*sikharam*) of a moving golden mountain (*jaṅgamakanakagiriṃ*) enveloped in a red woolen blanket (*rattakambalaparikkhittamiva*).\nAt that time (*tasmiṃ samaye*), it is said (*kira*), having come forth (*nikkhamitvā*) from the body (*sarīrato*) of the Ten-Powered One (*dasabalassa*), six-colored rays (*chabbaṇṇarasmiyo*), all around (*samantā*) in an area the size of eighty hands (*asītihatthappamāṇe padese*) rushed (*ādhāvanti*), sped (*vidhāvanti*), like a bejeweled courtyard (*ratanāveḷa*) scattered with strings of jewels (*ratanadāma*) and powder of jewels (*ratanacuṇṇa*), like a spread cloth (*paṭamiva*) painted with jewels (*ratanacitta*) and gold (*kañcana*), like something sprinkled with the essence of red gold (*rattasuvaṇṇarasanisiñcamānamiva*), like something teeming with a hundred meteors (*ukkāsatanipātasamākulamiva*), like *kaṇikāra* flowers (*kaṇikārapupphamiva*) scattered without interruption (*nirantara*), like powder (*cuṇṇamiva*) of Chinese flour (*cīnapiṭṭha*) thrown (*khitta*) by the force of the wind (*vāyuvega*), and like a forest clearing (*vanaantaraṃ*) shimmering and sparkling with dispersed and scattered rainbows (*indadhanuvijjulatātārāgaṇappabhāvisaravipphuritaviccharitamiva ca*) was (*hoti*).\nAnd furthermore (*ca pana*), the body (*sarīraṃ*) of the Blessed One (*bhagavato*), adorned (*anurañjitañca*) with the eighty minor marks (*asīti anubyañjana*), was like a blossoming lotus (*vikasitakamaluppalamiva*), like a lake (*saraṃ*) full of blooming *sabba* water lilies (*pāliphullamiva*), a *pāricchattakaṃ*, like a sky sparkling with starlight (*tārāmarīcivikasitamiva*), like the surface of the sky (*gaganatalaṃ*) mocking with glory (*siriyā avahasantamiva*), and as for his garland (*mālā*) of thirty-two excellent marks (*dvattiṃsavaralakkhaṇa*), shining with a fathom's extent of light (*byāmappabhāparikkhepavilāsinī*), having been strung together (*ganthetvā*), as if surpassing in glory (*siriṃ siriyā abhibhavantimiva*) the glory of thirty-two moon garlands (*ṭhapitadvattiṃsacandamālāya*), thirty-two sun garlands (*dvattiṃsasūriyamālāya*), [and] thirty-two emperor garlands (*dvattiṃsacakkavattidvattiṃsasakkadevarājadvattiṃsamahābrahmānaṃ*) placed in order (*paṭipāṭiyā ṭhapita*).\nAnd those monks (*bhikkhū*) standing (*ṭhitā*) surrounding (*parivāretvā*) that Blessed One (*tañca pana bhagavantaṃ*) were all (*sabbeva*) of few wishes (*appicchā*), content (*santuṭṭhā*), fond of solitude (*pavivittā*), aloof (*asaṃsaṭṭhā*), exhorters (*codakā*), censors of evil (*pāpagarahino*), teachers (*vattāro*), tolerant of correction (*vacanakkhamā*), endowed with virtue (*sīlasampannā*), concentration (*samādhi*), wisdom (*paññā*), emancipation (*vimutti*), and the knowledge and vision of emancipation (*vimuttiññāṇadassanasampannā*).\nIn their midst (*tesaṃ majjhe*), the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), was like a golden pillar (*kañcanathambho*) surrounded (*parikkhitto*) by a red woolen rampart (*rattakambalapākāra*), like a golden boat (*suvaṇṇanāvā*) amidst a cluster of red lotus flowers (*rattapadumasaṇḍamajjhagatā*), like a tower of flame (*aggikkhandho*) encircled by a coral railing (*pavāḷavedikāparikkhitto*), or like the full moon (*puṇṇacando*) surrounded by the host of stars (*tārāgaṇaparivārito*), pleased (*pīṇayati*) the eyes (*cakkhūni*) even of the birds and beasts (*migapakkhīnampi*), much more (*pageva*) then [did he please] the eyes of gods and humans (*devamanussānaṃ*).\nAnd on that day (*tasmiñca pana divase*), for the most part (*yebhuyyena*) eighty great *theras* (*asītimahātherā*) having made (*karitvā*) their cloud-colored (*meghavaṇṇaṃ*) rag robes (*paṃsukūlaṃ*) one-shouldered (*ekaṃsaṃ*), taking (*ādāya*) their walking sticks (*kattaradaṇḍaṃ*), like perfumed elephants (*gandhahatthino*) clad in solid armor (*suvammavammitā viya*), free from corruptions (*vigatadosā*), their corruptions ejected (*vantadosā*), their defilements shattered (*bhinnakilesā*), their tangles disentangled (*vijaṭitajaṭā*), and their bonds cut (*chinnabandhanā*) surrounded (*parivārayiṃsu*) the Blessed One (*bhagavantaṃ*).\nHe (*so*), himself (*sayam*) without lust (*vītarāgo*) [and] with those without lust (*vītarāgehi*), himself (*sayam*) without hatred (*vītadoso*) [and] with those without hatred (*vītadosehi*), himself (*sayam*) without delusion (*vītamoho*) [and] with those without delusion

Even now (*etarahipi kho*), monks (*bhikkhave*), in the present time (*paccuppannaṃ addhānaṃ*), beings (*sattā*) come together and meet (*saṃsandanti samenti*) according to their elements (*dhātusova*); those with inferior inclinations (*hīnādhimuttikā*)… those with noble inclinations (*kalyāṇādhimuttikā*) come together and meet with those with noble inclinations (*kalyāṇādhimuttikehi saddhiṃ saṃsandanti samentī*).\" Thus, the diverse inclinations (*nānādhimuttikatā*), diverse dispositions (*nānajjhāsayatā*), diverse views (*nānādiṭṭhikatā*), diverse tolerances (*nānākhantitā*), diverse preferences (*nānārucitā*) of beings (*sattānaṃ*), like measuring with a *nāḷī*, like weighing with scales (*tulāya*), are known (*viditā*) by the knowledge of diverse inclinations (*nānādhimuttikatāñāṇena*), by the knowledge of omniscience (*sabbaññutaññāṇena*), that which is well-known (*sā suppaṭividitā*).\nEven two beings (*dvepi sattā*) with the same disposition (*ekajjhāsayā*) are difficult to find in the world (*lokasmiṃ*).\nWhen one wants to go (*ekasmiṃ gantukāme*), the other wants to stay (*eko ṭhātukāmo hoti*); when one wants to drink (*ekasmiṃ pivitukāme*), the other wants to eat (*eko bhuñjitukāmo*).\nAmong these two teachers and students (*dvīsu ācariyantevāsīsu*), this is because \"*Suppiyo the wanderer… closely follows the Blessed One… and the monastic community* (*bhagavantaṃ piṭṭhito piṭṭhito anubandhā honti bhikkhusaṅghañcā*),\"\nThere, \"*itihameti* \" means \"*itiha* \" these (*ime*), thus it means \"these\" (*evaṃ imeti attho*).\nThe rest is as already stated (*sesaṃ vuttanayameva*).",

    "commentary_english": "4. Furthermore, the Exalted One, realizing the monks' discussion—here, \"realizing\" means knowing through his knowledge of omniscience ( *sabbaññutaññāṇa*).\n\nIndeed, the Exalted One knows by seeing with his physical eye in some instances, just as in: \"The Exalted One saw a large log being carried away by the current of the river Ganges,\" etc. (Saṃyutta Nikāya 4.241).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by seeing with his divine eye, just as in: \"The Exalted One saw, with his divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, those deities accepting items in Pāṭaligāma worth a thousand,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 2.152).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by hearing with his ordinary ear, just as in: \"The Exalted One heard Āyasmā Ānanda's conversation with Subhadda the wandering ascetic,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 2.213).\n\nIn other instances, he knows by hearing with his divine ear, just as in: \"The Exalted One heard, with his divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, Sandhāna the householder's conversation with Nigrodha the wandering ascetic,\" etc. (Dīgha Nikāya 3.54).\n\nBut here, he knew by hearing through his knowledge of omniscience.\n\nWhat was he doing when he knew? [He was engaged in] the activity of the last watch of the night. And this activity is of two kinds: beneficial ( *sātthakaṃ*) and useless ( *niratthakaṃ*).\n\nOf these, all tendencies to useless activity were abolished by the Exalted One with his attainment of the path of *arahatship* at the *bodhi* tree itself.\n\nBut from then on, the Exalted One remained engaged only in beneficial activity.\n\nThis is of five kinds: the activity before the meal ( *purebhattakiccaṃ*), the activity after the meal ( *pacchābhattakiccaṃ*), the activity of the first watch of the night ( *purimayāmakiccaṃ*), the activity of the middle watch ( *majjhimayāmakiccaṃ*), and the activity of the last watch ( *pacchimayāmakiccaṃ*).\n\nHere, the activity before the meal is as follows: The Exalted One would rise early in the morning and, out of compassion for his attendant and for the sake of his physical well-being, attend to his morning ablutions, such as washing his face. Then he would remain seated in seclusion until the time for the alms round. When the time for the alms round arrived, he would change his lower robe, fasten the waistband, put on the upper robe, and, taking his bowl, enter the village or town for alms; sometimes he would go alone, sometimes with a retinue of *bhikkhus*; sometimes naturally, sometimes with many miracles occurring.\n\nFor example, when the Lord of the World went for alms, gentle winds would go before him, clearing the ground. Clouds would sprinkle drops of water to still the dust along the path, and then remain as a canopy overhead. Other winds would gather flowers and strew them along the road. The elevated areas of the ground would lower themselves, and the depressed areas would raise themselves, so that the ground was always level beneath the tread of his feet. Sometimes, lotus flowers with a comfortable touch, the size of chariot wheels, would receive his feet.\n\nAs soon as he placed his right foot inside the city gate, six-colored rays would emanate from his body, adorning the mansions, peaked houses and other buildings, making them appear like they were enveloped in golden-hued colors or surrounded by painted cloths, darting here and there. Elephants, horses, birds, and other creatures, while standing in their places, would make sounds in a sweet manner, as well as drums, lutes, and other musical instruments and ornaments worn on the bodies of people.\n\nBy these signs, people would know, \"Today, the Exalted One has entered here for alms.\"\n\nThen, well-dressed and well-groomed, bringing scents, flowers, and other offerings, they would come out of their houses, enter the main street, respectfully honor the Exalted One with scents, flowers, and other offerings, pay homage to him, and ask, \"Venerable Sir, give us ten *bhikkhus*, give us twenty, give us fifty... up to... a hundred,\" and, taking the Exalted One's bowl, prepare a seat and respectfully fill it with alms food.\n\nHaving completed his meal duties, the Exalted One would survey the minds of those beings and teach them the *Dhamma* in such a way that some would become established in the refuges (*saraṇagamanesu*), some in the five precepts (*pañcasu sīlesu*), some in one of the fruits of *sotāpatti* (stream-enterer), *sakadāgāmi* (once-returner), or *anāgāmi* (non-returner); others, having gone forth into homelessness, would reach the highest fruit of *arahatship*.\n\nHaving benefited the multitude in this way, he would rise from his seat and go to the monastery ( *vihāraṃ*).\n\nThere, having gone to the pavilion ( *maṇḍalamāḷe*), he would sit down on the excellent Buddha seat that had been arranged, waiting for the *bhikkhus* to finish their meal duties.\n\nThen, when the *bhikkhus* had finished their meal duties, the attendant would inform the Exalted One.\n\nThen the Exalted One would enter the Perfumed Chamber ( *gandhakuṭiṃ*).\n\nThis, first of all, is the activity before the meal.\n\nThen, after having completed the pre-meal duties in this way, the Exalted One would sit in the antechamber of the Perfumed Chamber, wash his feet, and, standing on the footstool, would exhort the *bhikkhu* *saṅgha*, \" *Bhikkhus*, strive with diligence! Rare is the appearance of a Buddha in the world, rare is the obtaining of human existence, rare is prosperity, rare is the going forth, rare is the hearing of the true *Dhamma*.\"\n\nThere, some would ask the Exalted One for a meditation subject (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ*).\n\nThe Exalted One would then give them a meditation subject suitable to their disposition (*cariyānurūpaṃ*).\n\nThen all of them, having paid homage to the Exalted One, would go to their respective places for the night or for the day.\n\nSome would go to the forest (*araññaṃ*), some to the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūlaṃ*), some to one of the mountains, etc., some to the heaven of the Four Great Kings (*cātumahārājikabhavanaṃ*)...pe...some to the heaven of those with power over others' creations ( *vasavattibhavanaṃ*).\n\nThen the Exalted One, having entered the Perfumed Chamber, if he wished, would lie down for a moment on his right side in the lion's posture (*sīhaseyyaṃ*), mindful and fully aware.\nThen, with his body refreshed, he would rise and in the second portion would look at the world.\n\nIn the third part of the afternoon, the people of the village or town near which he was dwelling, who had given alms in the morning, would assemble in the monastery, well-dressed and well-groomed, bringing scents, flowers, and other offerings.\n\nThe Exalted One would approach, displaying whatever wonders were appropriate for the assembly present. Then, sitting down in his special seat in the assembly hall, he would teach the *Dhamma* in a way fitting the time and occasion. When the discourse was finished, he would dismiss the assembly, and the people, having done homage to him, would depart.\n\nThese were his afternoon activities.\n\nWhen he had finished his afternoon activities, if he wanted to bathe, he would rise up from his seat, enter the bathroom, and refresh his body with water brought by his attendant.\n\nThe attendant would also take the seat and prepare it in a cell in the Fragrant Collage.\n\nThe Exalted One, having put on a fresh well-dyed lower robe, fastened the waistband and arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, would return to his cell and sit alone for a few moments in solitary meditation. Thereafter the *bhikkhus* would arrive from various directions to attend upon the Master.\n\nSome would ask questions, some would request meditation subjects, some would ask about points of *Dhamma*.\n\nThe Exalted One would pass the first watch of the night complying with their requests.\n\nThese were his activities during the first watch of the night.\n\nWhen the first watch activities were completed and the *bhikkhus* had paid homage to the Master and departed, the deities of the entire ten-thousandfold world system would gain the opportunity to see the Exalted One. Having approached him, they would ask whatever questions might occur to them, even one only four syllables in length.\n\nAnswering the questions of those divine-beings, the Blessed One would spend the middle watch of the night.\n\nThese were his activities during the middle watch of the night.\n\nHe divided the last watch of the night into three parts. Because his body ached from silting continuously since early morning, he would spend one part pacing up and down to dispel the discomfort.\n\nIn the second part, he would enter the Fragrant Cottage and lie down on his right side, in the lion posture, mindful and clearly comprehending.\n\nIn the third part, he would rise, take a seat, and survey the world with the Buddha-eye in order to discover individuals who had observed their course of duties, such as giving alms and observing precepts, in the presence of the Buddhas of the past.\n\nThese were his activities during the last watch of the night.\n\nOn that day the Exalted One, after concluding his morning activities in *Rājagaha*, set out on his journey in the afternoon. In the first watch of the night he explained meditation subjects to the *bhikkhus*, and in the middle watch answered the questions of the deities. In the last watch, while pacing up and down on the walkway, he learned of the discussion taking place among the *bhikkhus* concerning his knowledge of omniscience, having heard it with his knowledge of omniscience itself.\n\nHence it was said – “he understood while doing the activities of the last watch of the night.”\n\nRealizing this, he thought: “These *bhikkhus* are holding a discussion concerning my knowledge of omniscience. The working of the knowledge of omniscience is not clear to them; it is clear only to me.\n\nBut when I have gone there, they will immediately tell me all about their discussion. Then, making their discussion the occasion for a discourse, as though lifting up Mount *Sineru* or pounding the sky with a golden mallet, I will teach the *Brahmajāla Sutta*. Within it I will analyze the three classes of virtue, roar my irreversible lion’s roar over the sixty-two cases of views, subsume the views under the law of conditionality, and having elucidated the Buddha-qualities, I will bring the teaching\n\nHaving thought thus, he approached the *maṇḍalamāḷa*.\n\nThat is, he should be approached by whatever part of the direction.\n\nOr, this is an instrumental word in the sense of location, that is, the meaning here is that he went to the place where that *maṇḍalamāḷa* was.\n\n\"Sit on the prepared seat\" - It is said that in the time of the Buddha, wherever even one *bhikkhu* was dwelling, everywhere a Buddha-seat was always prepared.\n\nWhy? The Exalted One, having taken a meditation subject from his own presence, while dwelling in a convenient place, directs his mind, thinking: “such and such a one has taken a meditation subject from my presence and gone away, will he be able to produce a distinction or not?”\n\nThen he sees him, having dismissed the meditation subject, reflecting upon an unwholesome thought. Then, “How is this? After this clansman has received a subject of meditation from a Master such as myself, should unwholesome thoughts overwhelm him and drive him on through the suffering of the beginningless round of existence?” In order to help him, the Exalted One would show himself to the *bhikkhu*, admonish him, and rising into the air, return to his own dwelling place.\n\nThen those *bhikkhus* who had been admonished would reflect: “The Master, knowing our minds, came here and showed himself, standing in our presence.\"\n\nAt that moment - \"Venerable Sir, sit here, sit here\" - the search for a seat is called a burden.\n\nTherefore, they would dwell having prepared a seat.\n\nHe who has a chair prepares it.\n\nHe who has none prepares a bed, or a bench, or a log, or a rock, or a heap of sand.\n\nNot obtaining that, they would also gather old leaves, and spread a discarded cloth over them, and set them in place.\n\nHere, however, there was only the king's sitting seat; having dusted it by beating, and prepared it, and surrounded it, those *bhikkhus*, praising the excellence of the Exalted One's knowledge of the dispositions, sat down.\n\nWith reference to that, it was said - “Sit on the prepared seat.”\n\nHaving thus sat down, however, knowing, for the purpose of raising up a discussion, he asked the *bhikkhus*:\n\nAnd they told him everything.\n\nTherefore it was said - \"Having sat down, indeed, the Exalted One\" - and so on.\n\nThere, what is the meaning: to what sort of talk are you sitting together?\n\n\"To what is there no body?\" is also a *pāḷi*, the meaning of that is: to what are you here? \"To what is there no body?\" is also a *pāḷi*.\nAnd its meaning is just like the previous one.\n\n*Antarākathā* means another, single conversation between instances of *kammaṭṭhāna*, attention, instruction, questioning, and so on.\n\n*Vippakatā* means unfinished, not having reached its peak, due to my arrival.\n\nWhat does that show? \"I have not come to interrupt your conversation, but I have come, through my omniscience, to bring your conversation to a conclusion, to bring it to the peak, and show it to you.\" Thus, seated, he institutes the invitation to the all-knowing.\n\nHere too, the meaning is: \"This, venerable sir, was our interrupted conversation when the Blessed One arrived.\"\n\n\"Venerable sir, this interrupted *guṇa* talk of ours concerned the Blessed One's knowledge of omniscience, and was not worldly talk or base talk. The Blessed One has arrived; please bring it to a conclusion and teach it to us now.\"\n\nAnd thus far, the introductory narrative spoken by the venerable Ānanda, concerning the lotus and blue water-lily pond, the pleasant descent, the jeweled staircase adorned with the beauty of the construction of a spotless stone surface, the expanse of ground resembling a scattered pearl surface strewn with sand, the bathing place as it were, surrounded by a well-divided wall and variegated platform, the desire to touch the path of the stars as it were, the pleasant ascent to the excellent palace of towering height, the staircase adorned with the shining beauty of the emergence of a mass of jewels bound by golden vines of smooth, soft ivory planks as it were, the sound mixed with the sounds of the striking of golden bracelets, anklets, and so on, the great house adorned with the magnificence of abundant wealth frequented by the household with sweet voices of speech and laughter, the great door with its well-established and wide doorposts shining with the abundance of the luster of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, coral, and so on for the pleasant entrance as it were, the basis adorned with time, place, region, topic, assembly, and occasion for the pleasant comprehension of this *sūtra* possessed of meaning and expression, indicative of the Buddha's power of virtue, has been spoken, the commentary on its meaning is complete.",

    "commentary_english": "5. Now, with the words “If, *bhikkhus*, others speak in dispraise of me,” and so on, the time has come to comment on the *sutta* delivered by the Exalted One.\n\nAnd that *sutta*-commentary [follows].\n\nAnd since this commentary will be clearer if we first examine the grounds on which the Exalted One delivers a *sutta*, we will deal with this latter point first.\n\nThere are four grounds for the delivery of a *sutta*: personal inclination (*attajjhāsaya*), the inclinations of others (*parajjhāsaya*), the proposal of a question (*pucchāvasika*) and the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattika*).\n\nAmong these, those *suttas* that the Exalted One declares entirely through his own inclination, without being requested by others, have personal inclination as the ground for their delivery. Some examples of this class are: the *Ākaṅkheyya Sutta*, the *Vattha Sutta*, the *Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta*, the *Mahāsaḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta*, the *Ariyavaṃsa Sutta*, and many *suttas* on the right endeavors (*sammappadhāna*), the bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*), the faculties (*indriya*), powers (*bala*), factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*), and factors of the path (*maggaṅga*). Their ground is personal inclination (*attajjhāsayo nikkhepo*).\n\nThose *suttas* that he declares by reason of the inclinations of others, after discerning their inclination, acquiescence, state of mind (*manas*), aspiration (*abhinīhāra*), and capacity for understanding (*bujjhana-bhāva*), have the inclinations of others as the ground for their delivery. An instance is the case of Rāhula: when the Exalted One perceived that the factors maturing in emancipation (*vimutti*) had reached maturity in Rāhula, he thought: “Let me now lead Rāhula to the destruction of the cankers (*āsava*).\" Some *suttas* of this class are: the *Cūḷarāhulovāda Sutta*, the *Mahārāhulovāda Sutta*, the *Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta*, the *Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta*; their ground is the inclinations of others (*parajjhāsayo nikkhepo*).\n\nWhen the four assemblies (*parisā*), the four classes (*vaṇṇā*), *nāgas*, *supaṇṇas*, *gandhabbas*, *asuras*, *yakkhas*, the Great Kings (*mahārājāno*), the gods (*devā*) of the Heaven of the Thirty-three (*tāvatiṃsa*), and *Mahābrahmās* approach the Exalted One and ask questions— about the factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*)— they say, “*Bojjhaṅga*, *bojjhaṅga*, venerable sir (*bhante*)”.\n\n“Hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*), hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*)” they say, venerable sir (*bhante*). “Are these, venerable sir (*bhante*), the five aggregates of clinging (*pañcupādānakkhandhā*)?”\n\nThe \"best treasure of man,\" and so on, asks the question.\n\nTo this class belong numerous *suttas* of the *Bojjhaṅga-saṃyutta* and other suttas, and the *Devatā-saṃyutta*, *Māra-saṃyutta*, *Brahma-saṃyutta*, *Sakkapañha*, *Cūḷavedalla*, *Mahāvedalla*, *Sāmaññaphala*, *Āḷavaka*, *Sūciloma*, *Kharaloma Suttas*, etc.; their ground is the proposal of a question (*pucchāvasiko nikkhepo*).\n\nAnd those *suttas* declared because a special incident had occurred—examples are the *suttas Dhammadāyāda*, *Cūḷasīhanāda*, the *Candūpama*, *Puttamaṃsūpama*, *Dārukkhandhūpama*, *Aggikkhandūpama*, *Pheṇapiṇḍūpama*, and *Pāricchattakūpama*; these have the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiko*) as the ground for their pronouncement (*nikkhepo*).\n\nOf these four grounds (*nikkhepa*), this *sutta* has the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiko nikkhepo*) as the ground for its delivery.\n\nSince it was delivered by the Exalted One on account of the occurrence of a special incident (*aṭṭhuppattiyā*).\n\nAnd what was that incident (*aṭṭhuppattiyā*)? Praise and dispraise (*vaṇṇāvaṇṇe*).\n\nThe teacher spoke in dispraise (*avaṇṇa*) of the Triple Gem (*ratanattaya*), the pupil in praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*).\n\nThus, making praise and dispraise the occasion, the Exalted One, skilled in teaching, began the discourse with the words “If, *bhikkhus*, others speak in dispraise of me.”\n\nThere \"mine,\" that is a word expressing ownership, the meaning is \"mine.\"\n\nThe letter ‘va’ (*vā*) has the sense of *vikappana*.\n\nOthers means beings who are opposed.\n\nThere means among those who speak dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nAlthough there was no resentment (*āghāta*) in those *bhikkhus*, the Buddha set up a guideline (*dhamma-netti*) in order to prohibit clansmen in the future from arousing unwholesome states of mind (*akusala-uppatti*) under similar circumstances.\n\nThere, \"it strikes the mind,\" is resentment (*āghāta*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for anger (*kopa*).\n\n\"They are displeased (*appatītā*), therefore unsatisfied (*atuṭṭhā*), unhappy (*asomanassikā*),\" is discontent (*appaccaya*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for sadness (*domanassa*).\n\n\"He does not delight in what is beneficial (*hita*) for himself or others\" is delightlessness (*anabhiraddhi*); this is a designation (*adhivacana*) for anger (*kopa*).\n\nThus here, with two terms, the aggregate of volitional formations (*saṅkhārakkhandha*), and with one term, the aggregate of feeling (*vedanākkhandha*)—thus two aggregates (*khandhā*) are spoken of.\n\nBy reason of them, the cause (*kāraṇa*) of the remaining associated states (*sampayuttadhammā*) is refuted.\n\nHaving thus, by the first statement, warded off mental displeasure (*mano-padosa*), by the second statement, showing the danger (*ādīnava*) there, he said, “If you were to become angry (*kupitā*) or upset (*anattamanā*), you would only be creating an obstacle (*antarāya*) for yourselves.\"\n\nThere, “If you were to become angry” means, among those who speak dispraise (*avaṇṇabhāsakesu*), or in that dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), if you were to be; the meaning is, if you were to be.\n\n\"Angry\" (*kupitā*) means with anger (*kopa*), \"upset\" (*anattamanā*) with sadness (*domanassa*).\n\n\"'You would only be creating an obstacle (*antarāya*) for yourselves'\" means, for you, with that anger (*kopa*), and with that being upset (*anattamanatāya*), there would be an obstacle (*antarāyo*) to the first *jhāna* and so on.\n\nHaving thus, by the second statement, shown the danger (*ādīnavaṃ*), by the third statement, showing inability (*asamatthataṃ*), even in merely recognizing the meaning of what is said (*vacanatthasallakkhaṇa*), he said, “Would you be able (*api nu tumhe*)…?” and so on.\n\nThere, \"of others\" (*paresanti*) means of anyone at all (*yesaṃ kesaṃ ci*).\n\nFor an angry person knows neither the meaning (*atthaṃ*) of what is well-spoken (*subhāsita*) nor of what is ill-spoken (*dubbhāsita*) to Buddhas, Private Buddhas (*paccekabuddha*), noble disciples (*ariyasāvaka*), mothers, fathers, or opponents (*paccatthika*).\n\nAs he said: Thus, in all ways, having prohibited mental displeasure (*manopadosaṃ*) with regard to dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), now, showing the way in which to proceed (*paṭipajjitabbākāraṃ*), he said: “There, by you, what is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*) as untrue (*abhūtato*)…” and so on.\n\nThere, there, \"by you\" means, in that dispraise (*avaṇṇe*), by you.\n\nWhat is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*) should be refuted as untrue (*abhūtato*) means, what is untrue (*abhūtaṃ*), that should be removed (*apanetabbaṃ*) as untrue (*abhūtabhāvena*).\nHow [is this done]? By the method beginning with \" *iti petaṃ abhūtaṃ* \" and so forth.\n\nHere is the interpretation: \"If you should hear others say: ‘Your teacher is not omniscient *sabbaññū*, the *dharma* is badly expounded, the *saṃgha* is practicing wrongly,’\" and so forth, you should not remain silent.\n\nYou should reply: \"What you say is false. For this reason it is false; for this reason, it is untrue. There is no such thing in us; this is not found among us. Our teacher is omniscient, the *dharma* is well expounded, the *saṃgha* is practicing the good path. Such and such is the reason.\"\n\nHere, it should be understood that the second phrase is a synonym of the first, and the fourth is a synonym of the third.\n\nThis unraveling should be undertaken only in the case of dispraise (*avaṇṇa*), not in all cases.\n\nFor if someone were to say, \"You are depraved (*dussīlo*), your teacher is depraved, you did this and that, your teacher did [this and that],\" and you should remain silent and hear it patiently, you should be cautious.\n\nTherefore, putting away ill will (*manopadosaṃ akatvā*), you may unravel the dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nBut if anyone should abuse you with any of the ten forms of abuse—calling you a buffalo (*oṭṭho*), an ox (*goṇo*), etc.—you should look upon him with equanimity (*ajjhupekkhitvā*) and practice forbearance and patience (*adhivāsanakhanti*).",

    "commentary_english": "6. Thus, having shown the characteristics in the realm of dispraise, now, in order to show it in the realm of praise, he says, \"Whether others might speak in praise of me, *bhikkhus*,\" and so on.\n\nThere, \"others\" means whatever gods and humans are serene.\n\nIt is called *ānanda* because one rejoices with it; this is a designation for rapture (*pīti*).\n\nThe state of being of good mind is gladness (*somanassa*); this is a designation for mental pleasure (*cetasikasukha*).\n\nThe state of being exhilarated is exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*).\n\nWhose is exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*)? It belongs to the mind (*cetasoti*).\n\nThis is a designation for the rapture of exultation (*uppilāpanapīti*) that brings elation (*uddhaccāvahāya*).\n\nHere also, with two words, the aggregate of formations (*saṅkhārakkhandha*) is spoken of, and with one, the aggregate of feeling (*vedanākkhandha*) is spoken of.\n\nThus, by the first method, having warded off exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*), by the second, showing the danger (*ādīnava*) in that, he says, \"If you were to become jubilant there,\" and so on.\n\nHere also, \"you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves (*tumhaṃ yevassa tena antarāyo*),\" meaning that, through that exhilaration (*uppilāvitatta*), an obstacle (*antarāyo*) would arise for you to the first *jhāna*, etc.; this is the meaning to be understood.\n\nWhy was this said? Didn't the Blessed One describe only rapture and gladness (*pītisomanassa*) in the jewels in many hundreds of *suttas*, beginning with, \"Those *bhikkhus* who are serene in the Buddha, are serene in the highest,\" and so on?\n\nIt is true, it was described, but that is dependent on renunciation (*nekkhamma*).\n\nHere, the intention is the rapture and joy (*pītisomanassa*) connected with worldliness, the kind that arises by thinking in this way: \"Our Buddha, our Dhamma,\" and so on, like that which arose for venerable Channa (*āyasmato channassa*).\n\nFor that is what creates an obstacle to attaining the first *jhāna*, etc. (*jhānādipaṭilābhāya antarāyakaraṃ hoti*).\n\nFor that reason, even the venerable Channa (*āyasmā channo*), until the Buddha passed away into final *nirvāṇa*, was not able to produce distinction, but at the time of final *nirvāṇa*, having been threatened by the *brahmadaṇḍa* declared by him, having abandoned that rapture and gladness (*pītisomanassa*), he produced distinction.\n\nTherefore, it should be understood that this was said having in mind only that which creates an obstacle (*antarāyakaraṃ*).\n\nThis rapture (*pīti*) is associated with greed (*lobhasahagatā*).\n\nAnd greed (*lobho*) is similar to anger (*kodha*).\n\nAs he said, \"However, a third statement, though not come here, should be understood as implicit.\"\n\nFor the greedy man, like the angry man, does not understand the meaning of what is spoken.\n\nThis is the interpretation of the section showing the proper course of practice: \"If you should hear others say: 'Your teacher is omniscient (*sabbaññū*), a Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*), the Dhamma is well expounded (*svākkhāto*); the Saṅgha is practicing the good path (*suppaṭipanno*),' you should not remain silent.\"\n\nYou should acknowledge it thus: \"What you say is a fact. For this reason it is a fact; for this reason it is true.\"\n\nThe Exalted One, for such and such a reason, is a Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), a perfectly enlightened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*); the Dhamma, for such and such a reason, is well expounded (*svākkhāto*), visible here and now (*sandiṭṭhiko*); the Saṅgha, for such and such a reason, is practicing the good path (*suppaṭipanno*), practicing the straight path (*ujuppaṭipanno*).\"\n\nIf asked: 'Are you virtuous (*sīlavā*)?', you may claim: 'I am virtuous (*sīlavāhamasmī*).'\n\nIf asked: ‘Have you gained the first *jhāna*? ...’ etc., or ‘Are you an *arhat*?', then you may admit the fact, but only to fellow *bhikkhus* (*sabhāgānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ*).\n\nIn this way domination by evil desires is avoided, and the fruitfulness of the Dispensation (*sāsana*) of the Buddha is made plain.\n\nThe rest should be understood in the way already described (*vuttanayeneva*).",

    "commentary_english": "7. \"Appamattakaṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhaveti\": What is the connection? This *sutta* is bound by two terms: praise (*vaṇṇa*) and dispraise (*avaṇṇa*).\n\nThere, dispraise is refuted by pointing out: “For such and such a reason this is false (*abhūtaṃ*), this is untrue (*ataccha*).” etc., just as fire is extinguished by submerging it in water.\n\nAnd praise is confirmed by acknowledging fact as fact thus: “For such and such a reason this is a fact (*bhūtaṃ*).”\n\nPraise is of two kinds: that spoken by Brahmadatta and that spoken by the company of *bhikkhus* beginning with \"Wonderful, friend!\" (*acchariyaṃ āvuso*), etc.\n\nAmong them, the Master will show the sequel to the praise spoken by the company of *bhikkhus* later in the *sutta*, in the section on the elucidation of emptiness (*suññatā*).\n\nHere he begins the teaching by showing the sequel to the praise spoken by Brahmadatta: “*Appamattakaṃ kho panetaṃ, bhikkhave*.”\n\nThere, \"*appamattaka*\" is a name for insignificance (*paritta*).\n\n\"*Oramattaka*\" is a synonym of that.\n\n\"*Mattā*\" means measure (*pamāṇaṃ*).\n\n\"*Appaṃ mattā etassa*\" means insignificant (*appamattakaṃ*).\n\n\"*Oraṃ mattā etassa*\" means inferior (*oramattakaṃ*).\n\nVirtue (*sīla*) itself is just virtue (*sīlamattakaṃ*).\n\nThis is what is meant: ‘*Appamattakaṃ kho, panetaṃ bhikkhave, oramattakaṃ sīlamattakaṃ*’ means that a worldling might speak even after making an effort, saying “I will speak praise of the *Tathāgata*.”\n\nHere it might be asked: Surely virtue (*sīla*) is the supreme adornment (*aggavibhūsanaṃ*) of a *yogin*? As the ancients have said: And the Exalted One himself has extolled virtue in many hundreds of *suttas*.\n\nFor example: “If, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu* should wish: ‘May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the holy life (*sabrahmacārī*), revered and esteemed,’ he should be perfect in fulfilling the rules of conduct (*sīla*)” etc. (Ma. Ni. 1. 65).\n\n“As, *bhikkhus*, whatever seed groups (*bījagāma*) and vegetable groups (*bhūtagāma*) come to growth (*vuḍḍhiṃ*), increase (*virūḷhiṃ*) and maturity (*vepullaṃ*), all do so by being dependent on the earth (*pathavī*); so these seed groups and vegetable groups come to growth, increase and maturity.\n\nEven so, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu*, by relying on virtue (*sīla*), by being established in virtue, developing the seven factors of enlightenment (*sattabojjhaṅga*), cultivating the seven factors of enlightenment, comes to growth, increase and maturity in the Dhamma” (Saṃ. Ni. 5. 150).\n\nThus also other many *suttas* should be seen.\n\nAnd so too in many other *suttas* virtue is extolled.\n\nThen why does he say “insignificant (*appamattaka*)” in this instance? He does so by placing the superior qualities above.\n\nFor virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration (*samādhi*) and concentration does not reach the level of the excellence of wisdom (*paññā*). Therefore, in comparison with the higher qualities, the inferior ones are called “insignificant (*oramattakaṃ*).”\n\nHow is it that virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration? The Exalted One, after he was fully enlightened, in the seventh year, at the city gate of Sāvatthī, at the foot of the Kaṇḍamba tree, in a jewelled pavilion twelve *yojanas* wide, while sitting on a jewelled divan one *yojana* wide, under a divine white parasol three *yojanas* wide, before an assembly of people extending for twelve *yojanas* in all directions, showing his acceptance of the challenge posed by the sectarians and quelling their forces, performed the twin miracle: “From the upper part of his body a mass of fire issued forth, and from the lower part a stream of water… from each hair-pore a mass of fire issued forth, and from each hair-pore a stream of water, of six colors,” and so on.\n\nFrom his body of golden color, rays of golden color issued forth, continuing on to the summit of existence (*bhavagga*), as if it were a time of adorning the entire ten-thousandfold world sphere. The remaining colored rays, issuing from his body in turn according to color, came forth so that they appeared to come forth simultaneously, at a single moment.\n\nAnd there is no occurrence of two acts of consciousness (*citta*) at a single moment.\n\nBut in the case of the Buddhas, by reason of the brevity of their stay in the *bhavaṅga* and through their fivefold mastery, the differently colored rays appeared to come forth at a single moment.\n\nBut in reality the adverting, preparation, and resolution for each colored ray is done separately.\n\nThe Exalted One attains the blue *kasiṇa* absorption in order to produce the blue rays, the yellow *kasiṇa* in order to produce the yellow rays, the red and white *kasiṇas* in order to produce the red and white rays, the fire *kasiṇa* in order to produce the mass of fire, and the water *kasiṇa* in order to produce the stream of water.\n\nThe Master paces up and down, while projected images of himself stand or sit or lie down and so on; all may he explained at length.\n\nIn all this, there is not even one thing that was accomplished by virtue. All was accomplished by concentration.\n\nThus virtue does not reach the level of the excellence of concentration.\n\nMoreover, what the Exalted One, after fulfilling the perfections (*pārami*) for four incalculable periods of a hundred thousand *kappas*, at the age of twenty-nine, departing from the palace that was the glorious abode of a wheel-turning monarch (*cakkavatti*), going forth on the bank of the Anoma River, practicing striving (*padhānayoga*) for six years, on the Visakha full-moon day, after partaking of milk-rice (*madhupāyāsa*) mixed with divine nourishment that had been offered by Sujātā in the village of Uruvela, in the evening, entering the *bodhi-maṇḍa* from the south-east, circumambulating the king of *assattha* trees three times, standing on the north-eastern side, after spreading out a grass mat, after crossing his legs in the three-jointed lotus posture, having made goodwill (*mettā*) the foremost object of his attention, resolving on effort (*vīriya*), having made the trunk of the *bodhi* tree fifty *hatthas* high stand behind him like a silver column placed on a golden seat on a divan fourteen *hatthas* high, being sheltered above by the branch of the *bodhi* tree like a jeweled parasol, while the golden robes and the coral-like shoots of the *bodhi* tree fell down, as the sun was setting, dispelling the forces of Māra, in the first watch of the night recollecting his former abodes (*pubbenivāsa*), in the middle watch purifying the divine eye (*dibbacakkhu*), at dawn reflecting on the causal relations in the way that is habitual for all Buddhas, after developing the fourth *jhāna* based on mindfulness of breathing, after using that as his footing, after increasing insight (*vipassanā*), by means of the fourth path attained through the order of the paths, destroying all defilements (*kilesa*) and realizing all the qualities of a Buddha – this was his function of wisdom (*paññā*).\n\nThus concentration does not reach to the excellence of wisdom.\n\nThere, just as the water in the hand does not reach the water in a bowl, the water in a bowl does not reach the water in a jar, the water in a jar does not reach the water in a trough, the water in a trough does not reach the water in a pot, the water in a pot does not reach the water in a large pot, the water in a large pot does not reach the water in a cistern, the water in a cistern does not reach the water in a hollow, the water in a hollow does not reach the water in a small stream, the water in a small stream does not reach the water in the five great rivers, the water in the five great rivers does not reach the water in the great sea surrounding the *cakkavāḷa*, the water in the great sea surrounding the *cakkavāḷa* does not reach the water in the great sea at the foot of Mount Sineru.\nHaving placed water in a bowl, a small amount of water in the hand…and so on… having placed water in the ocean at the foot of Mount Meru, a small amount of water in the great *cakravāḷa* ocean.\n\nThus, taking much water from above, the water below becomes little.\n\nJust so, taking each higher quality above, virtue ( *sīla*) below should be understood as \"trifling\" and \"insignificant.\"\n\nTherefore, he said: \"Indeed, monks, this trifling, insignificant, mere virtue.\"\n\nRegarding \"by whom [is known] the worldling (*puthujjana*)\": Here, there, whoever does not have acquisition, questioning, hearing, retention, and reflection on the aggregates (*khandha*), elements (*dhātu*), sense-bases (*āyatana*), etc., this one is a blind worldling (*andha-puthujjana*).\n\nWhoever has those things, he is a virtuous worldling (*kalyāṇa-puthujjana*).\n\nThis one is twofold – he is a worldling (*puthujjana*) because of causes such as the generation, etc., of many kinds of defilements (*kilesa*), etc.\n\nAs he said: \"They generate a multitude of defilements, hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They have not destroyed the multiple forms of personality view (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They look up to a multitude of teachers (*satthar*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They have not emerged from the multitude of destinations, hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They form multiple kamma-formations (*abhisaṅkhāra*), hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are swept away by a multitude of floods (*ogha*), afflicted by a multitude of afflictions (*santāpa*), consumed by a multitude of fevers (*pariḷāha*)—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are lustful and greedy for the five strands of sense pleasure (*kāmaguṇa*): attached, desiring, tied, infatuated, deep-seated, clinging, attached, bound up—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*). They are covered, closed, enveloped, hidden, concealed, rejected by the five hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*)—hence they are worldlings (*puthujjana*).\"\n\nOne who is included among the multitude of people who live according to an inferior doctrine (*nīcadhammasamācāra*) and are averse to the doctrine of the *ariyas* ( *ariya-dhamma*), is called a worldling (*puthujjana*). And a person distinct or remote from the *ariyas* endowed with such qualities as virtue (*sīla*), learning (*suta*), etc., is called a worldling (*puthujjana*).\n\nThe Exalted One is called the *Tathāgata* for eight reasons.\n\nThe *Tathāgata* is so called because he has \"thus come\" (*tathā āgata*), because he has \"thus gone\" (*tathā gata*), because he has come to the real characteristic (*tathā-lakkhaṇaṃ āgata*), because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality (*tathā-dhamme yāthāvato abhisambuddha*), because he is a seer of the real (*tathā-dassitāya*), because he is a speaker of the real (*tathā-vāditāya*), because he acts in accordance with his teaching (*tathā-kāritāya*), and in the sense of surpassing (*abhibhavanaṭṭhena*).\n\nWhy is the Exalted One called the *Tathāgata* because he has \"thus come\"? Because the previous fully awakened Buddhas (*sammāsambuddha*) came, engaged in exertion for the welfare of the whole world (*sabba-loka-hitāya*), came—that is, as the Exalted Vipassī, the Exalted Sikhī, the Exalted Vessabhū, the Exalted Kakusandha, the Exalted Koṇāgamana, and the Exalted Kassapa .\n\nWhat does this mean? Our Exalted One has come through the very same aspiration (*abhinīhāra*) that these Exalted Ones came through.\n\nOr just as the Exalted Vipassī…pe… the Exalted Kassapa came after they had fulfilled the perfection of giving (*dāna-pāramī*) after fulfilling the perfections (*pāramī*) of virtue (*sīla*), renunciation (*nekkhamma*), wisdom (*paññā*), energy (*vīriya*), patience (*khanti*), truthfulness (*sacca*), determination (*adhiṭṭhāna*), loving kindness (*mettā*), and equanimity (*upekkhā*), came after they had fulfilled these ten perfections (*dasa pāramiyo*), ten intermediate perfections (*dasa upapāramiyo*), and ten ultimate perfections (*dasa paramatthapāramiyo*), making the full thirty perfections (*samatiṃsa pāramiyo*); made the five great relinquishments (*pañca mahāpariccāge*)—i.e., the relinquishing of limbs (*aṅga-pariccāga*), eyes (*nayana*), wealth (*dhana*), kingdom (*rajja*), and children and wife (*putta-dāra-pariccāga*); fulfilled the preliminary effort (*pubba-yoga*), the preliminary conduct (*pubba-cariya*), the preaching of the *Dhamma* (*dhamma-akkhāna*), conduct conducive to understanding, etc.; attained the limit of the practice of wisdom (*buddhi-cariyāya koṭiṃ patvā āgato*); just so has our Exalted One come.\n\nOr else, just as the Exalted Vipassī … Kassapa came by developing and cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhāna*), the four right endeavors (*sammappadhāna*), the four bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*), the five faculties (*indriya*), the five powers (*bala*), the seven factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*), and the Noble Eightfold Path (*ariyaṃ aṭṭhaṅgikaṃ maggaṃ*)—exactly thus has our Exalted One come.\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus come.”\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus come.”\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he has \"thus gone\"? Because as soon as he was born, the Exalted Vipassī went…pe… Kassapa went as soon as they were born.\n\nAnd how did that Exalted One go? As soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground, and then, facing north, went forward with a stride of seven steps.\n\nAs it is said: \"As soon as the *bodhisattva* was born, Ānanda, he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground; then, while a white parasol was held over him, facing north, he went forward with a stride of seven steps. Having surveyed all the directions, he then uttered the roar of the Leader of the Herd: 'I am the foremost in the world. I am pre-eminent in the world. I am supreme in the world. This is my last birth. There is now no renewal of existence.'\" (Dī.\n\nNi.\n\n2.\n31).\n\nAnd his way of going was real? Not unreal, for it was a foretoken of the achievements of distinction.\n\nWhen he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground,\n\nthat was the foretoken of his obtaining the four bases of spiritual success (*iddhipāda*).\n\nWhen he walked facing north (*uttarābhimukhabhāvo*), that was the foretoken of his supremacy in all the world.\n\nHis stride of seven steps foretokened his obtaining the gems of the seven factors of enlightenment (*bojjhaṅga*).\n\nThe golden-staffed chowries that appeared foretokened his defeat of all the sectarian teachers (*titthiya*).\n\nThe white parasol foretokened his obtaining the stainless white parasol of the supreme deliverance of arahatship.\n\nWhen he stood surveying all the directions after completing the seventh step, that foretokened his obtaining the unobstructed knowledge of omniscience.\n\nAnd his uttering the roar of the Leader of the Herd was the foretoken of his setting in motion the supreme, irreversible Wheel of the *Dhamma*.\n\nJust as the previous Exalted Ones went thus, exactly thus did the present Exalted One go. And his way of going was real, not unreal, for it foretokened the above achievements of spiritual distinction.\n\nTherefore, the ancients said: Thus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus gone.”\n\nOr alternatively, as the Exalted Vipassī … the Exalted Kassapa went, exactly thus did the present Exalted One go. That is, abandoning sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*) by renunciation (*nekkhamma*), ill will (*byāpāda*) by benevolence (*abyāpāda*), sloth-and-torpor (*thinamiddha*) by the perception of light (*āloka-saññā*), restlessness-and-remorse (*uddhacca-kukkuccaṃ*) by non-distraction (*avikkhepena*), and perplexity (*vicikicchaṃ*) by the defining of dhammas (*dhamma-vavatthānena*); shattering ignorance (*avijjā*) with knowledge (*ñāṇena*), dispelling discontent (*aratiṃ*) with joy (*pāmojjena*); knocking away the panel of the hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*) with the first jhāna (*paṭhamajjhānena*), making applied and sustained thought (*vitakka-vicāraṃ*) subside with the second jhāna (*dutiyajjhānena*), detaching from joy (*pītiṃ virājetvā*) with the third jhāna (*tatiyajjhānena*), abandoning pleasure and pain (*sukha-dukkhaṃ pahāya*) with the fourth jhāna (*catutthajjhānena*), and transcending the perception of form (*rūpa-saññā*), the perception of resistance (*paṭigha-saññā*), and the perception of diversity (*nānattasaññāyo*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of infinite space (*ākāsānañcāyatanasamāpattiyā*), transcending the perception of the sphere of infinite space (*ākāsānañcāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpattiyā*), transcending the perception of the sphere of infinite consciousness (*viññāṇañcāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpattiyā*), and transcending the perception of the sphere of nothingness (*ākiñcaññāyatanasaññaṃ*) by means of the attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception (*nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpattiyā*) went.\n\nBy insight into impermanence (*aniccānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of permanence (*niccasaññaṃ*), by insight into suffering (*dukkhānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of pleasure (*sukhasaññaṃ*), by insight into non-self (*anattānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of self (*attasaññaṃ*), by insight into aversion (*nibbidānupassanā*) abandoning delight (*nandiṃ*), by insight into dispassion (*virāgānupassanā*) abandoning passion (*rāgaṃ*), by insight into cessation (*nirodhānupassanā*) abandoning origination (*samudayaṃ*), by insight into relinquishment (*paṭinissaggānupassanā*) abandoning grasping (*ādānaṃ*), by insight into dissolution (*khayānupassanā*) abandoning solid perception (*ghanasaññaṃ*), by insight into decline (*vayānupassanā*) abandoning accumulation (*āyūhanaṃ*), by insight into change (*vipariṇāmānupassanā*) abandoning the perception of stability (*dhuvasaññaṃ*), by insight into the signless (*animittānupassanā*) abandoning the sign (*nimittaṃ*), by insight into the desireless (*appaṇihitānupassanā*) abandoning desire (*paṇidhiṃ*), by insight into emptiness (*suññatānupassanā*) abandoning clinging (*abhinivesaṃ*), by insight into higher wisdom-dhammas (*adhipaññādhammavipassanā*) abandoning clinging to the essence of appropriation (*sārādānābhinivesaṃ*), by seeing with knowledge of things as they really are (*yathābhūtañāṇadassanena*) abandoning clinging to delusion (*sammohābhinivesaṃ*), by insight into drawbacks (*ādīnavānupassanāya*) abandoning clinging to the home (*ālayābhinivesaṃ*), by reflective insight (*paṭisaṅkhānupassanāya*) abandoning non-reflection (*appaṭisaṅkhaṃ*), and by insight into turning away (*vivaṭṭānupassanāya*) abandoning clinging to attachment (*saṃyogābhinivesaṃ*), having shattered defilements (*kilesa*) associated with wrong views (*diṭṭhi*) by means of the path of stream-entry (*sotāpattimagga*), abandoning coarse defilements (*oḷārike kilese*) by means of the path of once-returning (*sakadāgāmimagga*), uprooting subtle defilements (*aṇusahagate kilese*) by means of the path of non-returning (*anāgāmimagga*), and cutting off all defilements (*sabbakilese*) by means of the path of arahatship (*arahattamagga*) went.\n\nEven so, he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “thus gone.”\n\nWhy is the *Tathāgata* called so because he has come to the real characteristic? The characteristic of hardness (*kakkhaḷatta-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the earth element (*pathavīdhātu*) is real, not unreal.\n\nThe characteristic of flowing (*paggharaṇa-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the water element (*āpodhātu*).\n\nThe characteristic of heat (*uṇhatta-lakkhaṇaṃ*) in the fire element (*tejodhātu*).\nThe wind element, of distending.\nThe space element, of intangibility.\nThe consciousness element, of cognizing.\nMaterial form, of deformation.\nFeeling, of being felt.\nPerception, of perceiving.\nThe mental formations, of forming.\nConsciousness, of cognizing.\nApplied thought, of application of mind.\nSustained thought, of continued pressure; rapture, of pervading.\nHappiness, of gratification.\nOne-pointedness of mind, of non-distraction.\nContact, of touching.\nThe faculty of faith, of resolution.\nThe faculty of energy, of exertion.\nThe faculty of mindfulness, of awareness.\nThe faculty of concentration, of non-distraction.\nThe faculty of wisdom, of understanding.\nThe power of faith, of not wavering because of faithlessness.\nThe power of energy, of not wavering because of laziness; the power of mindfulness, of not wavering because of forgetfulness.\nThe power of concentration, of not wavering because of restlessness; the power of wisdom, of not wavering because of ignorance.\nThe enlightenment factor of mindfulness, of awareness.\nThe factor of investigation of *dharmas*, of investigating.\nThe factor of energy, of exertion.\nThe factor of rapture, of pervading.\nThe factor of tranquility, of subsiding.\nThe factor of concentration, of non-distraction.\nThe factor of equanimity, of detached observation.\nRight view, of seeing.\nRight intention, of application of mind.\nRight speech, of embracing.\nRight action, of originating.\nRight livelihood, of cleansing.\nRight effort, of exertion.\nRight mindfulness, of awareness.\nRight concentration, of non-distraction.\nIgnorance, of unknowing.\nKamma-formations, of volition.\nConsciousness, of cognizing.\nMentality, of inclining.\nMaterial form has the characteristic of deformation.\nThe six sense bases have the characteristic of actuating.\nContact has the characteristic of touching.\nFeeling has the characteristic of being felt.\nCraving has the characteristic of causing.\nClinging has the characteristic of holding.\nExistence has the characteristic of accumulating.\nBirth has the characteristic of production.\nAging has the characteristic of decaying.\nDeath has the characteristic of passing away.\nThe elements have the characteristic of emptiness.\nThe sense bases have the characteristic of actuating.\nThe foundations of mindfulness have the characteristic of awareness.\nThe right endeavors have the characteristic of endeavoring.\nThe bases of spiritual success have the characteristic of succeeding.\nThe faculties have the characteristic of predominance.\nThe powers have the characteristic of unwavering.\nThe enlightenment factors have the characteristic of emancipating.\nThe path has the characteristic of being a cause.\nThe truths have the characteristic of reality.\nSerenity has the characteristic of non-distraction.\nInsight has the characteristic of contemplation.\nSerenity and insight have the characteristic of having a single flavor.\nThe pairs of complementary opposites have the characteristic of not exceeding one another.\nThe purification of virtue has the characteristic of restraint.\nPurification of mind has the characteristic of non-distraction.\nPurification of view has the characteristic of seeing.\nThe knowledge of destruction has the characteristic of eradication.\nThe knowledge of non-arising has the characteristic of tranquillity.\nDesire has the characteristics of being the root.\nAttention has the characteristic of being the originator.\nContact has the characteristic of collecting together.\nFeeling has the characteristic of convergence.\nConcentration has the characteristic of eminence.\nMindfulness has the characteristic of predominance.\nWisdom has the characteristic of supremacy.\nEmancipation has the characteristic of being the essence… *Nirvāṇa*, the plunge into the deathless, has the characteristic of being the consummation. All these characteristics are real, not unreal.\nThus, through the movement of his faculty of knowledge, he has come to the real characteristic; he has reached it without falling away from it, fully arrived at it—therefore he is the *Tathāgata*.\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has come to the real characteristic.\nHow has the *Tathāgata* awakened to real *dharmas* in accordance with actuality? The real *dharmas* are the four noble truths (*cattāri ariyasaccāni*).\nAs it is said: \"These four things, monks, are real, unerring, not otherwise.\"\n\nWhat are the four? 'This is suffering', monks, this is actual, unerring, not otherwise.\" (Saṃyutta Nikāya).\n\nIn detail.\n\nAnd the Exalted One awakened to those truths. Therefore, because of his awakening to the real *dharmas*, he is called the *Tathāgata*.\n\nHere, the word \"gone\" has the meaning \"awakened\".\n\nFurther, the fact that aging and death originate and commence with birth as condition is real, not unreal, not otherwise... The fact that the *saṅkhāras* (karmic formations) originate and commence with ignorance as condition is real, not unreal, not otherwise... Likewise, the fact that ignorance is the condition for the *saṅkhāras*, the *saṅkhāras* for consciousness... birth for aging and death, is real, not unreal, not otherwise.\n\nAll that the Exalted One awakened to. Therefore, because he awakened to real *dharmas*, he is called the *Tathāgata*.\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he awakened to real *dharmas* in accordance with actuality.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he is a seer of the real? In this world together with its gods... in this generation with its rulers and its men, whatever visible-form object there is that enters the threshold of the eye-door of the innumerable beings throughout the innumerable world systems—that the Exalted One knows and sees in all its modes.\n\nAnd knowing and seeing it thus, as desirable or undesirable, etc., and as found under the applicable term among the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized.\n\n\"What is that material form, the *rūpa-āyatana* (sense sphere of form)? That material form derivative upon the four primary elements that is of colored appearance, visible, impinging, blue, yellow,\" etc. . He has analyzed it under numerous names, in thirteen sections, and by fifty-two methods. This is real, not unreal.\n\nThe same method applies to sounds entering the threshold of the ear-door and so forth.\n\nFor the Exalted One has said: \"In this world, monks, together with its gods... in this generation with its rulers and its men, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, or examined by the mind—that I know.\n\nThat I have directly known. That the *Tathāgata* has understood. But the *Tathāgata* does not take a stand upon it.\"\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he is a seer of the real.\n\nHere the term \"*Tathāgata*\" should be understood to mean a seer of the real.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he is a speaker of the real? From the night when the Exalted One, sitting in the invincible posture on the terrace of enlightenment, crushed the heads of the three *Māras* and awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, to the night when he attained *parinibbāna* in the *nibbāna*-element without residue while lying between the twin *Sāl* trees, whatever the Exalted One spoke, whether in the first, middle, or final periods following the enlightenment—the discourses, mixed prose and verse... all that is impeccable in meaning and wording, neither deficient nor excessive, complete in every way, destroying the intoxication of passion, destroying the intoxication of hatred and delusion.\n\nThere is not even as much as a hair’s tip in this that is defective. It all appears as though it had been stamped with a single seal, measured with a single ruler, or weighed upon a single pair of scales. It is all real, not unreal.\n\nAs it is said: \"Between the night when the *Tathāgata* awakens to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains *parinibbāna* in the *nibbāna*-element without residue, whatever he speaks, utters, or expounds—all that is real, not otherwise.\n\nTherefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.\"\n\nFor here the word *gata* has the meaning of enunciation.\n\nHence he is the *Tathāgata* because he is a speaker of the real.\n\nFurther, the word *āgada* or *āgadana* means “pronouncement”; that is, a statement.\n\nHis pronouncement is real and undistorted. Thus, changing the letter *d* to a *t*; the derivation of the word “*Tathāgata*” may be understood in this sense.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* because he practices what he teaches? The bodily action of the Exalted One conforms to his speech, and his speech conforms to his bodily action; therefore he is one who practices what he teaches and teaches what he practices.\n\nSince he is of such a nature, his bodily action has “gone thus,” proceeding in accordance with his speech.\n\nand his speech has “gone thus,” proceeding in accordance with his bodily action; thus he is the *Tathāgata*.\n\nAs it is said: \"As the *Tathāgata* speaks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks.\n\nSince he does as he speaks and speaks as he does.\n\nTherefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.\"\nni.\n4. 23).\nThus, he is the *Tathāgata* because he acts in accordance with his teaching.\n\nWhy is he called the *Tathāgata* in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing? From the peak of existence (*bhava-agga*) downwards, and from the *Avīci* hell upwards, throughout the innumerable world systems (*lokadhātu*), the *Tathāgata* surpasses all beings in virtue (*śīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), wisdom (*prajñā*), and emancipation (*vimutti*), and knowledge-and-vision of emancipation (*vimutti-ñāṇa-dassana*). There is none his equal or measure. He is unequalled (*atula*), immeasurable (*appameyya*), incomparable (*anuttara*)—the king of kings (*rājātirājā*), the god of gods (*devadeva*), the *Śakka* above all *Śakkas*, the *Brahmā* above all *Brahmās*.\n\nThus it is said: “In this world, *bhikkhus*, together with its gods, etc., in this generation with its rulers and its men, the *Tathāgata* is the vanquisher (*abhibhū*), the unvanquished (*anabhibhūto*), the universal seer (*aññadatthudaso*), the wielder of power (*vasavattī*). Therefore he is called the *Tathāgata*.”\n\nHere the word-derivation (*padasiddhi*) should be understood as follows.\n\nLike a medicine (*agada*).\n\nWho is this? His elegance of teaching (*desanāvilāsamayo*) and his accumulation of merit (*puññussayo*).\n\nFor by means of these, he vanquishes all the rival teachers as well as this world together with its gods in the same way that a powerful physician (*bhisakko*) vanquishes snakes with a divine medicine (*dibbāgadena*).\n\nThus his medicine (*agado*) for vanquishing all the world is his real, undistorted elegance of teaching (*desanāvilāsamayo*) and his accumulations of merit (*puññussayo*).\n\nChanging the letter *da* to a *ta*, the derivation of the word “*Tathāgata*” may be understood thus.\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* in the sense of vanquishing (*abhibhavanaṭṭhena*).\n\nFurthermore, he is the *Tathāgata* because he has “gone through reality” (*tathāya gato*), and because he has “really gone” (*tathaṃ gato*).\n\nHere “gone” (*gato*) has the meanings of undergone (*avagato*), gone beyond (*atīto*), attained (*patto*), and practiced (*paṭipanno*).\n\nThus he is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., undergone (*avagato*)—reality by fully understanding the entire world (*sakalaloka*) through the scrutinization (*tīraṇapariññāya*).\n\nHe is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., gone beyond (*atīto*)—reality by fully understanding the world through the abandonment of its origin (*lokasamudayaṃ pahānapariññāya*).\n\nHe is the *Tathāgata* because he has gone through—i.e., attained (*patto*)—reality by realizing the cessation of the world (*lokanirodhaṃ sacchikiriyāya*).\n\nAnd he is the *Tathāgata* because he has really gone along—i.e., practiced (*paṭipanno*)—the way leading to the cessation of the world (*lokanirodhagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ tathaṃ gato*).\n\nThus it was said by the Exalted One (*bhagavatā*) - Thus the meaning should be understood.\n\nBut this is the mere introduction (*mukhamattaṃ*) to the explanation of the nature of a *Tathāgata* (*tathāgatabhāva-dīpane*).\n\nFor only a *Tathāgata* himself can explain the nature of a *Tathāgata* (*tathāgatabhāvaṃ*) in its completeness (*sabbākārena*).\n\nWhat, *bhikkhus*, is that by which an ordinary person (*puthujjana*) speaking the praise (*vaṇṇaṃ*) of the *Tathāgata* might speak, asking, \"What is that?\". Therein, what is a question (*pucchā*)? A question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*), a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*), a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*), a question of consent (*anumatipucchā*), a question of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatā pucchā*)—it is fivefold (*pañcavidhā hoti*).\n\nTherein, what is a question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) the characteristic (*lakkhaṇaṃ*) is unknown (*aññātaṃ hoti*), unseen (*adiṭṭhaṃ*), unweighed (*atulitaṃ*), uninvestigated (*atīritaṃ*), undeveloped (*avibhūtaṃ*), unmanifested (*avibhāvitaṃ*). He asks a question (*pañhaṃ pucchati*) for the knowledge (*ñāṇāya*), seeing (*dassanāya*), weighing (*tulanāya*), investigating (*tīraṇāya*), and manifestation (*vibhāvanāya*) of it. This is a question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) the characteristic (*lakkhaṇaṃ*) is known (*ñātaṃ hoti*), seen (*diṭṭhaṃ*), weighed (*tulitaṃ*), investigated (*tīritaṃ*), developed (*vibhūtaṃ*), and manifested (*vibhāvitaṃ*).

This is a question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*)? By nature (*pakatiyā*) there is a tendency to doubt (*saṃsayapakkhando hoti*), a tendency to uncertainty (*vimatipakkhando*), being of two minds (*dveḷhakajāto*): \"Is it thus (*evaṃ nu kho*), or is it not thus (*na nu kho*), what is it (*kinnu kho*), how is it (*kathaṃ nu kho*)?\".\n\nHe asks a question (*pañhaṃ pucchati*) for the purpose of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanatthāya*).\n\nThis is a question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of consent (*anumatipucchā*)? The Exalted One (*bhagavā*) asks the *bhikkhus* a question out of consent (*anumatiyā pañhaṃ pucchati*) – \"What do you think (*taṃ kiṃ maññatha, bhikkhave*), is form (*rūpaṃ*) permanent (*niccaṃ*) or impermanent (*aniccaṃ vā*)\"?\n\nImpermanent (*aniccaṃ*), venerable sir (*bhante*).\n\nIs that which is impermanent (*yaṃ panāniccaṃ*), suffering (*dukkhaṃ*) or happiness (*sukhaṃ vā*)? Suffering (*dukkhaṃ*), venerable sir (*bhante*).\n\nEverything should be spoken (*sabbaṃ vattabbaṃ*), this is a question of consent (*ayaṃ anumatipucchā*).\n\nWhat is a question of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatā pucchā*)? The Exalted One (*bhagavā*) asks the *bhikkhus* a question out of wanting to speak (*kathetukamyatāya pañhaṃ pucchati*).\n\nThere are these four foundations of mindfulness (*cattārome, bhikkhave, satipaṭṭhānā*).\n\nWhat are the four (*katame cattāro*)? ... These are the eight constituents of the path (*aṭṭhime bhikkhave maggaṅgā*).\n\nWhat are the eight (*katame aṭṭha*)? This is a question of wanting to speak (*ayaṃ kathetukamyatā pucchā*).\n\nThus, in these five questions, since there is no unseen quality (*adiṭṭhassa dhammassa*) of any kind, therefore there is no question of illuminating the unseen (*adiṭṭhajotanā pucchā*) for the *Tathāgata*.\n\nSince the thought does not even arise (*samannāhārasseva anuppajjanato*), “I will compare it (*saṃsanditvā desessāmi*) with other learned ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (*aññehi paṇḍitehi samaṇabrāhmaṇehi saddhiṃ*),\" therefore there is also no question of comparing what has been seen (*diṭṭhasaṃsandanā pucchāpi natthi*).\n\nSince there is no wavering (*āsappanā parisappanā natthi*) in even one quality for the Buddhas (*buddhānaṃ ekadhammepi*), all doubts are cut off (*sabbā kaṅkhā chinnā*) at the *Bodhi* tree (*bodhimaṇḍeyeva*); therefore there is certainly no question of cutting off doubt (*vimaticchedanā pucchāpi natthiyeva*).\n\nBut the remaining two questions (*avasesā pana dve pucchā*) exist for the Buddhas (*buddhānaṃ atthi*), among those this is called a question of wanting to speak (*ayaṃ kathetukamyatā pucchā nāma*).",

    "commentary_english": "8. Now, desiring to explain that which was asked in the question, [the text] begins with \"Having abandoned killing living beings\".\n\nThere, *pāṇātipāta* is the transgression against living beings, *pāṇavadha* is the killing of living beings, and *pāṇaghāta* is the destruction of living beings.\n\nHere, the word *pāṇa* conventionally signifies a being ( *satta*), but in the ultimate sense ( *paramattha*), it is the life-faculty ( *jīvitindriya*). \"Killing living beings\" ( *pāṇātipāta*) is the volition ( *cetanā*) of killing in one who perceives a living being as such, which occurs through one of the doors of body or speech, and initiates the act of cutting off that living being’s life-faculty.\n\nIn the case of beings devoid of moral qualities such as animals, the act of killing is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the being is small ( *khuddake*) in size, and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjo*) when the body is large ( *mahāsarīre*). Why? Because of the magnitude of the effort ( *payogamahantatāya*).\n\nAnd when the effort ( *payoga*) involved is equal, it depends on the magnitude of the object ( *vatthu*).\n\nIn the case of beings endowed with moral qualities such as humans, the act of killing is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the being has few moral qualities ( *appaguṇe*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjo*) when the being has many moral qualities ( *mahāguṇe*).\n\nWhen the size of the body and moral qualities are equal, however, it should be understood that it is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjo*) when the defilements ( *kilesānaṃ*) and activity ( *upakkamānañca*) are mild ( *mudutāya*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjoti* ) when they are strong ( *tibbatāya*).\n\nThere are five constituents for this: a living being ( *pāṇo*), awareness that it is a living being ( *pāṇasaññitā*), the mind to kill ( *vadhakacittaṃ*), activity ( *upakkamo*), and the death thereby ( *tena maraṇaṃ*).\n\nThere are six means: one’s own person ( *sāhatthiko*), command ( *āṇattiko*), a missile ( *nissaggiyo*), a fixed contrivance ( *thāvaro*), a magical spell ( *vijjāmayo*), supernormal power ( *iddhimayo*).\n\nWhen this meaning is expanded, it becomes excessively complex ( *papañco*). Therefore, we shall not expand upon it, but [discuss] something else of this nature.\n\nThose who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the *Samantapāsādika*, the Vinaya Commentary.\n\n\"Having abandoned\" means having abandoned this bad conduct ( *dussīlyaṃ*), known as the thought of killing living beings ( *pāṇātipātacetanāsaṅkhātaṃ*).\n\n\"Abstaining\" means truly abstaining from that bad conduct, beginning from the time of abandoning it.\n\n\"There is no thought of transgressing\" means that, just as with physical actions, the meaning should be understood in the same way in other such passages with regard to things cognizable by the eye and ear.\n\n*Samaṇa* means the Blessed One ( *bhagavā*) who has gained the designation because he has calmed evil ( *samitapāpatāya laddhavohāro*).\n\n*Gotama* [is used] because of [his] lineage ( *gottavasena*).\n\nIt is not only the Blessed One ( *bhagavāyeva*) who abstains from killing living beings (*pāṇātipātā paṭivirato*), but the community of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅghopi*) also abstains ( *paṭivirato*). The teaching ( *desanā*) has come thus from the beginning ( *ādito paṭṭhāya evaṃ āgatā*), but it is fitting for one who is explaining the meaning ( *atthaṃ pana dīpentena*) to also explain it in terms of the community of monks ( *bhikkhusaṅghavasenāpi dīpetuṃ vaṭṭati*).\n\n\"Having laid down the stick, having laid down the weapon\" means that the meaning is \"because he does not wield a stick or weapon to harm others, he has laid down the stick and laid down the weapon\".\n\nHere, it should be understood that after setting aside the stick ( *daṇḍaṃ*), all the remaining equipment ( *avasesaṃ upakaraṇaṃ*) is a weapon ( *sattham*) because it has the nature of harming beings ( *sattānaṃ viheṭhanabhāvato satthanti veditabbaṃ*).\n\nBut that which monks, having taken a knife, a tooth-stick, an axe, or a razor, wander about with, that is not for harming others ( *parūpaghātatthāya*).\n\nTherefore, he is called one who has laid down the stick, who has laid down the weapon ( *nihitadaṇḍo nihitasattho*).\n\n\"Conscientious\" ( *lajjīti*) means possessed of conscientiousness ( *lajjāya samannāgato*) characterized by disgust for evil ( *pāpajigucchanalakkhaṇāya*).\n\n\"Compassionate\" means one who has attained compassion ( *dayaṃ āpanno*) and a mind of loving-kindness ( *mettacittataṃ*).\n\n\"Having compassion for the welfare of all living beings\" means he is compassionate with a mind to benefit all living beings ( *sabbe pāṇabhūte hitena anukampako*).\n\nThe meaning is that through this attainment of compassion ( *dayāpannatāya*), there is a mind to benefit all living beings ( *sabbesaṃ pāṇabhūtānaṃ hitacittakoti attho*).\n\n\"Dwells\" means poses, moves, guards, persists, carries on, lives, dwells ( *iriyati yapeti yāpeti pāleti*).\n\nThus, or indeed, monks.\n\nThe word \"or\" is said to be used above in the sense of option, having considered \"Having abandoned taking what is not given\", etc. Thus, everywhere, the nature of option should be understood having considered what comes before or what comes after.\n\nNow, here is a summary: Monks, when a worldling ( *puthujjano*) speaks the praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vadamāno*) of the Tathāgata ( *Tathāgatassa*), he would say thus: \"The ascetic ( *samaṇo*) Gotama does not kill ( *na hanati*) a living being ( *pāṇaṃ*), nor does he cause [another] to kill ( *na ghāteti*), nor does he approve ( *na tattha samanuñño hoti*) of it. He abstains ( *virato*) from this evil conduct ( *imasmā dussīlyā*). Oh, how great are the qualities of the Buddha ( *buddhaguṇā mahantā*)!\" Thus, having made a great effort ( *mahantaṃ ussāhaṃ katvā*), even though he wishes to speak praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vattukāmopi*), he would only speak ( *vakkhati*) of a trifling and insignificant amount ( *appamattakaṃ oramattakaṃ*)—mere virtue and [good] conduct ( *ācārasīlamattakameva*).\n\nRelying upon the extraordinary qualities above ( *upari asādhāraṇabhāvaṃ nissāya*), he will not be able to speak praise ( *vaṇṇaṃ vattuṃ na sakkhissati*).\n\nIt is not only the worldling ( *puthujjanova*), but even stream-enterers ( *sotāpanna*), once-returners ( *sakadāgāmi*), non-returners ( *anāgāmi*), *arhats* ( *arahanto*) and even *paccekabuddhas* ( *paccekabuddhāpi*) are not able ( *na sakkonti*). Only the *Tathāgata* ( *Tathāgatoyeva*) is able ( *sakkoti*). We will speak of that above ( *taṃ vo upari vakkhāmi*). This is a meaningful explanation ( *ayamettha sādhippāyā atthavaṇṇanā*).\n\nFrom here on ( *ito paraṃ pana*) we will explain only the words that have not been explained previously ( *apubbapadameva vaṇṇayissāma*).\n\nIn \"Having abandoned taking what is not given\" ( *adinnādānaṃ pahāyāti*), taking what is not given ( *adinnassa ādānaṃ*) is *adinnādāna*, the carrying off of another’s goods ( *parasaṃharaṇaṃ*), stealing ( *theyyaṃ*), robbery ( *corikāti vuttaṃ hoti*).\n\nThere ( *tattha*), \"what is not given\" ( *adinnanti*) is what is possessed by another ( *parapariggahitaṃ*), where another person, exercising free control as he wishes ( *yathākāmakāritaṃ āpajjanto*), is neither liable to punishment nor blame ( *adaṇḍāraho anupavajjo ca hoti*).\n\nIn the case of that which is possessed by another ( *tasmiṃ parapariggahite*), the volition of theft ( *theyyacetanā*) in one who perceives it as possessed by another ( *parapariggahitasaññino*), which initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thing ( *tadādāyakaupakkamasamuṭṭhāpikā*), is \"taking what is not given\" ( *adinnādānaṃ*).\n\nThat ( *taṃ* ) is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjaṃ*) in the case of another's property of low value ( *hīne parasantake*), and more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjaṃ*) when it is of high value ( *paṇīte*). Why? Because of the value of the object ( *vatthupaṇītatāya*).\n\nWhen the objects are equal in value ( *vatthusamatte sati*), the act is more blameworthy ( *mahāsāvajjaṃ*) when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities ( *guṇādhikānaṃ santake vatthusmiṃ*).\n\nTaking that very thing ( *taṃ taṃ*) from one with superior qualities ( *guṇādhikaṃ upādāya*), the act is less blameworthy ( *appasāvajjaṃ*) when the object belongs to one of inferior qualities ( *hīnaguṇassa santake vatthusmiṃ*) compared to that ( *tato tato*).\n\nThere are five components of this ( *tassa pañca sambhārā honti*): property belonging to another ( *parapariggahitaṃ*), the perception of the property belonging to another as such ( *parapariggahitasaññitā*), the thought of stealing ( *theyyacittaṃ*), the act ( *upakkamo*), and the removal of the article ( *tena haraṇanti*).\nThere are six means: one's own person, etc. ( *sāhatthikādayova*).\nAnd these may be classified, according to the way in which they occur, by way of the following: taking by theft (*theyyāvahāro*), by force (*pasayhāvahāro*), by concealment (*paṭicchannāvahāro*), by stratagem (*parikappāvahāro*), by fraud (*kusāvahāro*). This here is in brief (*ayamettha saṅkhepo*).\nThe details, however, are given in the Samantapasadika.\n\"He takes only what is given,\" therefore he is a taker of what is given (*dinnādāyī*).\n\"Even with his mind, he only anticipates what has been given,\" therefore, he is one who anticipates only what has been given (*dinnapāṭikaṅkhī*).\n*Theṇa* means a thief (*theno*).\nNot by theft, by non-theft (*athenena*).\nIndeed, through non-theft, he abides in purity (*sucibhūtena*).\n*Attanā* means by way of self-nature (*attabhāvena*).\nIt is said that by making that non-theft the pure self, he dwells (in purity) (*athenaṃ sucibhūtaṃ attānaṃ katvā viharatīti vuttaṃ hoti*).\nThe remainder should be connected in the same way as stated in the first precept (*sesaṃ paṭhamasikkhāpade vuttanayeneva yojetabbaṃ*).\nAnd as in this case, so with all (*yathā ca idha, evaṃ sabbattha*).\n*Abrahmacariya* means uncelibate conduct (*aseṭṭhacariyaṃ*).\nOne who practices the highest conduct, the *brahma*, is a *brahmacārī*.\n*Ārācārī* means one who keeps far from uncelibate conduct (*abrahmacariyato dūracārī*).\n*Methuna* means unrighteous practices (*asaddhammā*) that have attained the designation *methuna*, because they are similar due to being overcome by passion (*rāgapariyuṭṭhānavasena sadisattā methunakāti*), and because they should be avoided by those who have obtained the designation.\n*Gāmadhamma* means the practices of village dwellers (*gāmavāsīnaṃ dhammā*).",

    "commentary_english": "9. Having abandoned false speech, here, *musā* (falsehood) is vocal or bodily effort destroying the welfare of others, preceded by deception. \"False speech\" is the volition with the intention to deceive, which brings about bodily or vocal effort to deceive others.\n\nAnother method: \"False\" (*musā*) means an unreal, untrue case (*abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ vatthu*).\n\n\"Speech\" (*vādo*) is the communication of that as being real, true.\n\nAccording to characteristic, \"false speech\" is the volition of one desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true, which initiates such an act of communication.\n\nThis is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight, and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great.\n\nFurther, when a householder, reluctant to part with a certain possession, denies that he owns it, it is of little blame; but when he is called to witness and lies for the sake of destroying another’s welfare, then the blame is heavy. For monks, the blame is light when they exaggerate in jest, e. g. , if after getting a little oil or ghee they say, “Oil flows like a river in the village today.” But the blame is heavy when they claim to have seen something they did not see.\n\nThere are four constituents of this act: an untrue case (*atathaṃ vatthu*), the mind to deceive (*visaṃvādanacittaṃ*), the appropriate effort (*tajjo vāyāmo*), the communicating of that meaning to another (*parassa tadatthavijānananti*).\n\nThere is one means, one’s own person only (*eko प्रयोगो साहत्थिकोव*).\n\nThat is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of speech.\n\nIf, through that action, the other understands that meaning, one is bound by the *kamma* of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the action.\n\nSince one deceives another through body, or through something attached to the body, or through speech, so too, one deceives another by ordering, \"Tell him this!”, or by writing a document, or by placing something in front [of someone], or by writing on walls and so on, \"This meaning is to be regarded thus.\"\n\nTherefore, here, applications such as command, relinquishment, and firmness are fitting. However, in the commentaries, because it is not in the future, it should be considered and taken up.\n\nSpeaking truth (*saccaṃ vadatīti*) is the truth-speaker (*saccavādī*).\n\nHe connects truth with truth and brings it about, therefore he is truth-connected (*saccasandho*).\n\nThe meaning is that he does not speak falsehood intermittently (*na antarantarā musā vadatīti attho*).\n\nFor if a person sometimes speaks falsehood and sometimes speaks truth, because truth is interrupted by falsehood, truth is not connected with truth; therefore, he is not truth-connected (*na saccasandho*).\n\nBut this person is not like that; even for the sake of his life, he does not speak falsehood, and he connects truth with truth; therefore, he is truth-connected (*saccasandho*).\n\n*Theto* means firm; the meaning is one with firm speech (*thiro thirakathoti attho*).\n\nFor one person, like turmeric dye, or like a stake stuck in a heap of chaff, or like a gourd placed on a donkey's back, is not one with firm speech; another person, like a line on a stone, or like Indra's post, is one with firm speech. Even if his head is cut off with a sword, he does not speak two speeches; this is called firm (*theto*).\n\nTrustworthy (*paccayiko*) means one who should be trusted, one who should be believed; this is the meaning.\n\nFor one person is not trustworthy; when it is said, \"This was spoken by whom? By so-and-so,\" he incurs the condition of being spoken to [by others], \"Do not trust his word\".\n\nOne person is trustworthy; when it is said, “This was spoken by whom? By so-and-so,” he incurs the condition of being spoken to [by others], “If it was spoken by him, this is indeed the measure; now there is no need to examine it; it is just like this.” This one is called trustworthy (*paccayiko*).\n\nHe does not deceive the world; the meaning is that, by means of that truth-speaking, he does not deceive the world (*avisaṃvādako lokassāti tāya saccavāditāya lokaṃ na visaṃvādetīti attho*).\n\nHaving abandoned malicious speech (*pisuṇaṃvācaṃ pahāya*), etc.: The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness for another is malicious speech (*sā pisuṇā vācā*).\n\nThe kind of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh, the kind of speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant neither to the ear nor to the heart — that is harsh speech (*pharusā vācā*).\n\nThat by which one gossips idly, without meaning, is gossip (*samphappalāpo*).\n\nAlso, the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name “malicious speech,” etc. And that only is intended here (*idhādhippetāti*).\n\nTherein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind (*saṃkiliṭṭhacittassa*), which initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among others or to endear oneself.\n\nThe act is less blameworthy when the person one divides has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.\n\nIts constituents are four: another person to be divided, the intention to divide, “Thus these will be separated and split” or the desire to endear oneself, “Thus I shall become loved and intimate,” the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to that person.\n\n\"For division of these\": it is for the division of those to whom it has been said and who have heard it in their presence.\n\n\"Or uniting those who are divided\": the doer and instigator is one who approaches each of two friends or those with a common teacher etc. who have been divided for some reason or other, and says, \"This is not right for you who were born in such a family and are so learned\" etc., and makes a connection.\n\nNon-giving of connection means the non-bestowal of connection (*sandhānānuppadātā*).\n\nHaving seen two united people, and having said - \"This is unbecoming for you who are born in such a family, who are endowed with such qualities\" etc., the meaning is that he is the doer of firm action (*daḷhīkammaṃ kattāti attho*).\n\nA park is united to him, therefore it is a united park (*samaggārāmo*).\n\nThe meaning is that he does not wish to live where there is no unity (*yattha samaggā natthi, tattha vasitumpi na icchatīti attho*).\n\n*Samaggarāmotipi* is the *pāḷi*, this itself is the meaning here.\n\n\"Delighting in unity\" means one who delights in those who are united; he does not wish to go elsewhere, having abandoned them; this is the meaning.\n\nHe delights, having seen or heard those who are united, therefore, he is one who delights in unity (*samagganandī*). Speaking speech that makes for unity (*samaggakaraṇiṃ vācaṃ bhāsitāti*): that speech which makes beings completely united, that speech speaks only of making clear the quality of unity, not another.\nHarsh speech is an entirely harsh thought that arises from an action of wounding the vital feelings of another through bodily or vocal means.\n\nThis is an example given for the purpose of making it clear: A village boy, it is said, went to the forest without heeding his mother’s words. Unable to make him turn back, she scolded him angrily, saying: “May a wild buffalo chase you!”\n\nThen a buffalo appeared before him right there in the forest.\n\nThe boy made an asseveration of truth, saying: “Let it not be as my mother said but as she thought!”\n\nThe buffalo stood as though tied there.\n\nThus, although the means was that of wounding the vital feelings, because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech.\n\nFor parents sometimes tell their children: “May robbers cut you into bits!” But in truth they do not want even a lotus leaf to fall on them.\n\nAnd preceptors and teachers sometimes say to their pupils: “What is the use with you shameless rascals. Get out!” Yet they wish their success in study and spiritual achievement.\n\nJust as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh, so through gentleness of speech, speech does not become unharsh.\n\nFor the words “Let him sleep in peace” spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech, but because of harshness of mind it is indeed harsh speech.\n\nIt is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.\n\nIts constituents are three: another to be abused, an angry mind, the abusing.\n\n\"Nela\" means \"fault\" (*doṣa*). Because there is no *ela* in it, it is *nela*, meaning without fault (*nirdoṣa*).\n\nFor example, “*nelaṅgo setapacchādo*”.\n\n(65) Here, it is like *nela* that was spoken.\n\n\"Pleasing to the ear\" (*kaṇṇasukha*) means pleasing to the ears because of the sweetness of the consonants. It does not produce ear-pain like being pierced by a needle.\n\n\"Arousing affection\" (*pemanīya*) means that it arouses affection by not producing anger in the whole body because of the sweetness of the meaning.\n\n\"Grasping the heart\" (*hadayaṅgama*) means that it goes to the heart and enters the mind pleasantly without being resisted.\n\n\"Noble\" (*porī*) means that it is perfect in virtue, comes to be in the city, is tender like a woman brought up in the city.\n\nIt is \"noble\" (*porī*) because it is of the city.\n\nIt means the speech of city-dwellers.\n\nFor city-dwellers have speech that is appropriate.\n\nThey call one who has only affection \"father\" (*pitā*), they call one who has only brightness \"brother\" (*bhātā*), they call one who has only measuring \"mother\" (*mātā*).\n\nBecause speech of such a kind is pleasing to many people, it is \"pleasing to many people\" (*bahujanakantā*).\n\nBecause it is pleasing to the mind and increases thought for many people just through its state of being pleasing, it is \"agreeable to many people\" (*bahujanamanāpā*).\n\nHaving abandoned idle chatter “Idle chatter” is the unwholesome volition occasioning the bodily or vocal effort to communicate something useless.\n\nIt is less blameworthy when indulgence is mild, more blameworthy when indulgence is great. There are two components: the disposition to engage in useless talk, such us talk on the great war of India or the abduction of Sītā, and the act of engaging in such talk.\n\n\"Speaking at the right time\" (*kālavādī*) means that he speaks after considering the appropriate time for speaking.\n\n\"Speaking the truth\" (*bhūtavādī*) means that he speaks of what is true, factual, and in accordance with reality.\n\n\"Speaking with a purpose\" (*atthavādī*) means that he speaks having relied only on the benefits of what is visible in this life and what will arise in future lives.\n\n\"Speaking the Dharma\" (*dhammavādī*) means that he speaks having relied on the nine supramundane *dharmas*. \"Speaking the Vinaya\" (*vinayavādī*) means that he speaks having relied on restraint, discipline, and abandonment discipline.\n\n\"Treasure\" (*nidhāna*) means a place for storing. Because there is a store in her, she is \"treasure-filled\" (*nidhānavatī*).\n\nIt means that she speaks speech that is appropriate for storing in the heart.\n\nBecause he always shines with timeliness, he does not speak out of season saying, “I will speak speech filled with treasure” but rather, he speaks only after giving consideration to what is the right time.\n\n\"With a pretext\" (*sāpadesa*) means with a simile (*saupama*), meaning with a reason (*sakāraṇa*).\n\n\"Having a limit\" (*pariyantavatinti*) means that after showing a demarcation, he speaks in such a way that its demarcation is understood.\n\n\"Connected with meaning\" (*atthasaṃhita*) means that because it is impossible to fully express it with many different means, he speaks speech endowed with meaning.\n\nOr, because that speaker of meaning (*atthavādī*) speaks with meaning (*attha*), through being connected with that meaning, he speaks speech connected with meaning (*atthasaṃhita*). It has been said that he does not set aside one thing and speak of another.",

    "commentary_english": "10. *Bījagāmabhūtagāmasamārambhāti*: “The undertaking of seed-group and being-group” means disrupting, by way of cutting, splitting, cooking, etc., the undertaking of the five kinds of seed-group, namely, *mūlabīja* (root-seed), *skandhabīja* (trunk-seed), *phaḷubīja* (shoot-seed), *agrabīja* (tip-seed), and *bījabīja* (seed-seed); as well as the being-group of any blue grass, tree, etc. from whatever source. This is the meaning.\n\n*Ekabhattikoti*: “Taking one meal” means the two meals: the morning meal (*pātarāsabhatta*) and the evening meal (*sāyamāsabhatta*). Among those, the morning meal is limited by the time before midday (*antomajjhanhikena*), the other [meal] is from midday upwards until dawn (*anto aruṇena*).\n\nTherefore, even someone eating ten times during before midday (*antomajjhanhike*), is still someone who takes one meal (*ekabhattikova*).\n\nWith reference to this, it is said, “one who takes one meal” (*ekabhattiko*).\n\n*Rattiyā bhojanaṃ ratti*, eating at night is night, ceasing from that, is ceasing from night (*rattūparato*).\n\nAfter midday (*majjhanhike*) until sunset (*sūriyatthaṅgamanā*), eating is called unseasonable eating (*vikālabhojanaṃ*).\n\nHaving ceased from that, one abstains from unseasonable eating (*vikālabhojanā*).\n\nWhen did he abstain? From the day of renouncing on the bank of the Anomā River (*anomānadītīre pabbajitadivasato paṭṭhāya*).\n\nBecause it is not in accordance with the teaching (*sāsanassa ananulomattā*), showing what is disorderly and improper (*visūkaṃ paṭāṇībhūtaṃ dassanaṃ*) is *visūkadassanaṃ* (improper seeing).\n\nBy oneself dancing, causing to dance, etc., dance (*naccā*) and song (*gītā*) and instrumental music (*vāditā*), even ultimately seeing dance etc. flourishing like peacock dances etc. (*mayūranaccādivasenapi pavattānaṃ naccādīnaṃ*) is a disorderly showing (*visūkabhūtā dassanā*), thus *naccagītavāditavisūkadassanā* (dance, song, instrumental music, improper seeing).\n\nFor monks and nuns, it is not proper to cause dance etc. (*naccādīni*) to be performed by oneself, or to cause [them] to be performed by others, or to see performances (*passituṃ*).\n\nAmong garlands etc., a garland (*mālā*) is whatever kind of flower (*pupphaṃ*).\n\nSmell (*gandho*) is whatever kind of fragrant substance (*gandhajātaṃ*).\n\nUnguent (*vilepanaṃ*) is causing color to the skin (*chavirāgakaraṇaṃ*).\n\nThere, wearing, it is called sustaining (*dhāreti*), filling what is lacking, it is called adorning (*maṇḍeti*), enjoying through the scent and through the color of the skin, it is called beautifying (*vibhūseti*).\n\n*Ṭhānaṃ* (basis) is called cause (*kāraṇaṃ*).\n\nTherefore, whatever flowers, garlands etc. (*mālādhāraṇādīni*) the masses do with immoral intention (*dussīlyacetanāya*), abstaining from that is the meaning.\n\nHigh couches (*uccāsayanaṃ*) are called exceeding the measure (*pamāṇātikkantaṃ*).\n\nLarge couches (*mahāsayananti*) are improper spreads (*akappiyapaccattharaṇaṃ*).\n\nAbstaining from that (*tato*), is the meaning.\n\nGold (*suvaṇṇaṃ*) is the noble metal (*jātarūpaṃ*).\n\nSilver (*rajataṃ*) is a *kahāpaṇa* coin, a copper *māsaka* coin, a resin *māsaka* coin, a wooden *māsaka* coin—whatever is used in commerce (*vohāraṃ gacchanti*).\n\nAbstaining from accepting both of those (*tassa ubhayassāpi paṭiggahaṇā*), he neither takes it himself (*na uggaṇhāti*), nor causes another to take it (*na uggaṇhāpeti*), nor approves of what has been put aside (*na upanikkhittaṃ sādiyatīti*). This is the meaning.\n\n*Āmakadhaññapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting raw grain” [means] accepting even the seven kinds of raw grain (*āmakadhaññassa*), enumerated as rice (*sāli*), *vīhi*, barley (*yava*), wheat (*godhūma*), *kaṅgu*, *varaka*, and *kudrūsaka*.\n\nNot only accepting those (*na kevalañca etesaṃ paṭiggahaṇameva*), but even touching them (*āmasanampi*) is not proper for monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ na vaṭṭatiyeva*).\n\n*Āmakamaṃsapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting raw meat” means here, except when it is specially allowed (*aññatra odissa anuññātā*), accepting raw meat and fish (*āmakamaṃsamacchānaṃ paṭiggahaṇameva*) is not proper for monks (*bhikkhūnaṃ na vaṭṭati*), not even touching [them] (*no āmasanaṃ*).\n\n*Itthikumārikapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting women and girls” means here, a woman (*itthī*) is one who has gone in between men (*purisantaragatā*), the other is called a girl (*kumārikā nāma*). Accepting and touching those (*tāsaṃ paṭiggahaṇampi āmasanampi*) is simply improper (*akappiyameva*).\n\n*Dāsidāsapaṭiggahaṇāti*: “Accepting male and female slaves” means here, accepting those (*tesaṃ paṭiggahaṇaṃ*) is not proper only by means of [them being] male and female slaves (*dāsidāsavaseneva*).\n\n“I give a monastic attendant (*kappiyakārakaṃ dammi*), I give a gardener (*ārāmikaṃ dammī*)”—when it is said thus (*evaṃ vutte*), it is proper (*vaṭṭati*).\n\nAmong sheep and goats etc. (*ajeḷakādīsu*), regarding fields, building sites and boundaries (*khettavatthupariyosānesu*), the principle of what is proper and improper (*kappiyākappiyanayo*) should be investigated according to the Vinaya (*vinayavasena upaparikkhitabba*).\n\nThere, a field (*khettaṃ nāma*) is that in which spring crops grow (*yasmiṃ pubbaṇṇaṃ ruhati*).\n\nA building site (*vatthu nāma*) is that in which autumn crops grow (*yasmiṃ aparaṇṇaṃ ruhati*).\n\nOr where both grow (*yattha vā ubhayampi ruhati*), that is a field (*taṃ khettaṃ*).\n\nLand prepared for that purpose (*tadatthāya akatabhūmibhāgo*) is a building site (*vatthu*).\n\nBy the head of fields and building sites (*khettavatthusīsena*), here also, ponds and tanks etc. (*vāpitaḷākādīnipi*) are included (*saṅgahitāneva*).\n\n*Dūteyyaṃ vuccati* is called the work of a messenger (*dūtakammaṃ*), taking a letter or message (*paṇṇaṃ vā sāsanaṃ vā gahetvā*) sent by laypeople (*gihīnaṃ pahitaṃ*) and going there and there (*tattha tattha gamanaṃ*).\n\n*Pahiṇagamanaṃ vuccati* is called the minor going (*khuddakagamanaṃ*) of one sent from house to house (*gharā gharaṃ pesitassa*).\n\n*Anuyogo nāma* is called doing both of those (*tadubhayakaraṇaṃ*).\n\nTherefore, *anuyogāti* is [called] the practice of messengers and errand-goers (*dūteyyapahiṇagamanānaṃ*).\nIn this way, the meaning should be understood here.\n*Kayavikkayā* means *kaya* and *vikkayā*.\nIn *tulākūṭa*, etc., *kūṭa* means deception.\nThere, *tulākūṭa* is of four kinds, namely: *rūpakūṭa*, *aṅgakūṭa*, *gahaṇakūṭa*, and *paṭicchannakūṭa*.\nThere, *rūpakūṭa* means making two equal balances, taking with a large [weight], and giving with a small one.\n*Aṅgakūṭa* means, while taking, pressing the balance with the hand on the back side, and while giving, [pressing] the front side.\n*Gahaṇakūṭa* means, while taking, grasping the rope at the root, and while giving, at the tip.\n*Paṭicchannakūṭa* means making the balance hollow, putting iron powder inside, and while taking, tilting it to the back side, and while giving, to the front side.\n*Kaṃsa* is called a gold plate; deceiving with that is *kaṃsakūṭa*.\nHow? Making one gold plate, and making two or three other metal plates of golden color, then going to a town, entering some modest family, and saying, \"Buy golden vessels!\" When the price is asked, they are willing to give a higher price.\nThen they say, \"How is the golden quality of these to be known?\" When told, \"Examine and take them,\" after rubbing the gold plate on a stone, he gives all the plates and leaves.\n*Mānakūṭa* is of three kinds based on *hadayabheda*, *sikhābheda*, and *rajjubheda*.\nThere, *hadayabheda* is obtained at the time of measuring ghee, oil, etc.\nWhen taking those, with a measuring container with a hole at the bottom, saying \"Pour slowly!\", after causing much to drip into the inner vessel, he takes it; when giving, closing the hole, quickly filling it, he gives.\n*Sikhābheda* is obtained at the time of measuring sesame, rice, etc.\nWhen taking those, slowly raising the top, he takes it; when giving, quickly filling it, cutting off the top, he gives.\n*Rajjubheda* is obtained at the time of measuring fields and land.\nNot obtaining profit, indeed, they measure the field, making even a small one large.\nAmong *ukkoṭana*, etc., *ukkoṭana* means taking the profit to make the ownerless into the owner.\n*Vañcana* is deceiving others by those various means.\nThere, this is one story: a hunter, having taken a deer and a fawn, is coming; a cheat tells him, \"Sir, what is the price of the deer? What is the price of the fawn?\"\nWhen told, \"The deer is two *kahāpaṇas*, the fawn is one,\" giving one *kahāpaṇa*, having taken the fawn, having gone a little, he returns, \"Sir, I don't need the fawn, give me the deer!\"\nThen [the hunter says]: \"Then give two *kahāpaṇas*!\"\nHe says, \"Sir, didn't I give you one *kahāpaṇa* before?\" \"Yes, you gave it.\"\n\"[Then] take this fawn, and that *kahāpaṇa*, and this fawn worth a *kahāpaṇa*, so there will be two *kahāpaṇas*.\"\nHe, recognizing that he is speaking a reason, having taken the fawn, did not give the deer.\n*Nikati* is deceiving with a likeness, making something unseemly seemly, making something that is not a gem seem like a gem, or making something that is not gold seem like gold, by means of skill or by means of magic.\n*Sāciyoga* is crooked conduct; this itself is the name of *ukkoṭana*, etc.\nTherefore, *ukkoṭanasāciyoga*, *vañcanasāciyoga*, *nikatisāciyoga*—in this way, the meaning should be seen here.\nSome say that showing one thing and exchanging it for another is *sāciyoga*.\nThat, however, is included in deception itself.\nAmong *chedana*, etc., *chedana* is cutting off the hand, etc.\n*Vadha* is killing.\n*Bandha* is binding by means of ropes, etc.\n*Viparāmosa* is of two kinds: *himaviparāmosa* and *gumbaviparāmosa*.\nThat which, at the time of snowfall, being covered by snow, deceive people walking on the path—this is *himaviparāmosa*.\nThat which, being covered by bushes, etc., deceive—this is *gumbaviparāmosa*.\n*Ālopa* is called the act of plundering villages, towns, etc.\n*Sahasākāra* is a violent act.\nHaving entered a house, placing a weapon on the chest of people, taking desired goods.\nThus, the ascetic Gautama refrains from mutilating… robbery… and violence.\n\nOr, bhikkhus, a common person, when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata, might speak thus:",

Now, expanding on the intermediate level of morality, he says, \"Just as some venerable ones...\" and so on.\n\nHerein lies the explanation of terms that are not obvious.\n\n\"Faith-offerings\" means gifts given with conviction in action (karma) and its result (phala), in this world (ihaloka) and the next world (paraloka).\n\nThe meaning is that gifts are not given thinking, \"This is my relative (ñātī),\" or \"my friend (mitto),\" or \"This one will reciprocate,\" or \"This was done by him previously.\"\n\nIndeed, things given in this way are not called faith-offerings (saddhādeyyāni).\n\n\"Foods\" is merely a summary designation, but in reality, faith-offerings include eating foods (bhojanāni bhuñjitvā), wearing robes (cīvarāni pārupitvā), making use of lodgings (senāsanāni sevamānā), and using medicine for the sick (gilānabhesajjaṃ paribhuñjamānā)—all of this is already included in what was said.\n\n\"Seyyathidam\" is a particle (nipāto).\n\nWhat is the meaning of that?

    "commentary_english": "12. \"Accumulation-and-use\" means the use of what has been accumulated.\n\nTherein, there are two kinds of talk: according to the *Vinaya*, and according to self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nFirstly, according to the *Vinaya*, whatever food has been accepted today becomes something to be accumulated if it is kept until the next day; in using it, there is an offense entailing confession (*pācittiya*).\n\nBut having given what was obtained by oneself to novices (*sāmaṇera*) and having had what was obtained by them kept, it is allowable to eat on the second day; but that is not self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nAnd the same rule applies in the case of accumulating drinks.\n\nTherein, \"drink\" means eight drinks beginning with mango juice, and whatever is in accordance with them.\n\nThe decision regarding them has been stated in the *Samantapāsādikā*.\n\nIn the case of accumulating robes, there is accumulation if there is a robe that has not been designated or dispensed with; and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*); this is a roundabout way of speaking.\n\nBut without a roundabout way, one should be content with three robes; having obtained a fourth, it should be given to another.\n\nIf one is not able to give to just anyone, and there is someone whom one wants to give to, and he has gone for instruction or questioning, it should be given as soon as he has arrived; it is not allowable not to give.\n\nBut when a robe is lacking, it is allowable to keep it until the time allowed, expecting that it will be ready.\n\nIf one cannot obtain people who can sew robes using a needle and thread, it is allowable to perform a *Vinaya* transaction and keep it even after that.\n\nIt is not allowable to keep it thinking, \"When this one is worn out, where will I obtain another like it?\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating vehicles, \"vehicle\" means a palanquin (*vayha*), a chariot (*ratha*), a cart (*sakaṭa*), a litter (*sandamānikā*), a palanquin (*sivikā*), a sedan chair (*pāṭaṅkī*); this is not a vehicle for one who has gone forth (as a renunciate).\n\nHowever, footwear (*upāhanā*) is indeed a vehicle for one who has gone forth.\n\nFor one monk, one pair of footwear is for the wilderness, and one is for washing the feet; at most, two pairs of footwear are allowable.\n\nHaving obtained a third, it should be given to another.\n\nIndeed, it is not allowable to keep it thinking, \"When this one is worn out, where will I obtain another?\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating beds, \"bed\" means a cot (*mañca*).\n\nFor one monk, one cot is for indoors, and one is for a daytime resting place; at most, two cots are allowable.\n\nHaving obtained more than that, it should be given to another monk or to the Order; it is not allowable not to give it.\n\nAnd it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\nIn the case of accumulating fragrances, fragrances are allowable for a monk when there is an ailment such as itching, scabies, skin disease, etc.\n\nHaving had those fragrances brought, when that disease has subsided, they should be given to others who are sick, or they should be taken to doors, five-finger houses, places of incense, etc.\n\nIt is not allowable to keep them thinking, \"They will be useful when there is disease again\"; and it is accumulation, and it obstructs self-effacement (*sallekha*).\n\n\"Relish\" is to be understood as what has been stated above.\n\nFor example, here a certain monk—thinking, \"It will be useful at such-and-such a time\"—has sesame seeds, husked rice, green grams, *māsa* beans, coconut shells, salt, fish, meat, dried meat, ghee, oil, molasses, pots, etc. brought and keeps them.\n\nIn the rainy season, having had rice gruel (*yāgu*) cooked by novices early in the morning, and having consumed it, he sends a novice, saying, \"Novice, it is difficult to enter the village in the mud and water. Go to such-and-such a family and announce my being in the monastery; bring curd (*dadhi*) etc. from such-and-such a family.\"\n\nEven when the monks say, \"Venerable sir, are you going to enter the village?\", he says, \"It is difficult to enter, friend, the village now.\"\n\nThey go thinking, \"Good, venerable sir, stay here, we will search for alms and bring them.\"\n\nThen that novice, having brought curd (*dadhi*) etc., and having prepared rice and side dishes, offers it; even while he is eating that, attendants send food, and he eats what is liked and liked.\n\nThen monks take alms food (*piṇḍapāta*) and come, and he eats what is liked and liked, even what is for the neck.\n\nIn this way, he spends even four months.\n\nThis is called, \"A monk lives a family life like a tonsured man, not a monastic life (*samaṇajīvika*).\"\n\nSuch an accumulation of relish is what it is called.\n\nHowever, in a monk's dwelling place, it is allowable to keep this much for the sake of thieves who may arrive at the wrong time: one *nāḷi* of husked rice, one lump of molasses, ghee to the amount of one quarter.\n\nFor if they do not obtain even this much means of hospitality, they might even deprive one of life; therefore, if there is not this much, it is also allowable to have it brought and kept.\n\nAnd at a time of discomfort, it is allowable to use oneself whatever is allowable there.\n\nHowever, even for one keeping a lot in an allowable hut, there is no accumulation.\nFurthermore, the *Tathāgata* has nothing set aside, such as a measure of rice grains or anything else, or even a piece of rag that is four spans in size, thinking, \"This will be mine today or tomorrow.\"",

    "commentary_english": "21. Now, as for the higher morality ( *mahāsīlaṃ* ) .\n\n*Aṅga*: the *aṅgasatthaṃ* is so called because it deals with the science of bodily marks (*aṅga*), stating that a person endowed with such and such a mark in his hands, feet, etc., will be long-lived and famous.\n\n*Nimitta* means the science of omens (*nimittasatthaṃ*).\n\nIt is said that King Paṇḍu once held three pearls in his fist and asked an interpreter of omens, “What is in my hand?” The latter looked here and there, and at that moment a house-lizard caught a fly and dropped a pearl. So he said, “Pearls!”\n\nAgain, when asked, “How many?” on hearing the sound of a cock crowing three times, he said, “Three!”\n\nThus, having instructed them in this and that, they live devoted to omens.\n\n*Uppāta* means the great portents such as the falling of thunderbolts, etc. On seeing them, they declare, “This will happen, thus it will happen.”\n\n*Supina* means that if someone sees a dream early in the morning, such and such will be the result; if someone sees such and such a thing, such and such will happen to him. In this way, they live devoted to dream interpretation.\n\n*Lakkhaṇa* means that a king is endowed with such and such marks; this one will be a sub-king, etc.\n\n*Mūsikacchinna* means gnawed by mice (*undūrakhāyitaṃ*).\n\nFurthermore, if a cloth, whether new (*ahata*) or old (*anahata*), is cut thus and so from here onwards, such and such will be the result. Thus they declare.\n\n*Aggihoma* means offering into the fire. If an offering (*hute*) of this kind is made with wood of this nature, such and such will be the result; hence, the act of offering into the fire (*aggijuhanaṃ*).\n\n*Dabbihoma*, etc., are also kinds of fire offerings (*aggihoma*). But because it is said that if an offering is made with a ladle (*dabbiyā*) of this kind, with grains (*kaṇādīhi*) of this sort, such and such will be the result, they are stated separately according to the course of events.\n\nThere, *kaṇoti* means a winnowing basket (*kuṇḍako*).\n\n*Taṇḍula* means grains of rice (*sāli*) and other cereals (*tiṇajātīnaṃ taṇḍulā*).\n\n*Sappi* means ghee made from cow’s milk (*gosappiādikaṃ*).\n\n*Tela* means sesame oil, etc. (*tilatelādikaṃ*).\n\nFurthermore, taking mustard seeds (*sāsapādīni*) in the mouth and throwing them into the fire, muttering spells (*vijjaṃ parijappitvā*), is called a mouth-oblation (*mukhahomaṃ*).\n\nOffering with the right eye, knee, blood, etc. (*dakkhiṇakkhakajaṇṇulohitādīhi*), is called a blood-oblation (*lohitahomaṃ*).\n\n*Aṅgavijjā*: Previously, *aṅga* was stated because having seen a limb (*aṅgameva*) itself, the limb is stated based on grammar (*byākaraṇavasena*). Here, having seen a measuring rod (*aṅgulaṭṭhiṃ*) and having calculated the science (*vijjaṃ parijappitvā*), this one is either a family man or not, either endowed with glory or not; thus, *aṅgavijjā* is stated based on the grammar, etc.\n\n*Vatthuvijjā* is the science of discerning the merits and demerits of house sites, park sites, etc. (*gharavatthuārāmavatthādīnaṃ guṇadosasallakkhaṇavijjā*).\n\nHaving seen the special qualities of the soil (*mattikādivisesaṃ*), and having calculated the science, they see the merits and demerits in a region thirty *ratanas* below the earth (*pathaviyaṃ*) and eighty *ratanas* above in the sky (*ākāse*).\n\n*Khattavijjā* means sciences (*sattha*) such as archery (*abbheyyam*), secret lore (*āsurakkhara*), royal science (*rājasattha*), and so on.\n\n*Sivavijjā* is the science of pacification practiced by entering a charnel ground (*susāne pavisitvā santikaraṇavijjā*); some also call it jackal-howling science (*siṅgālarutavijjātipi vadanti*).\n\n*Bhūtavijjā* means a mantra for dealing with spirits (*bhūtavejjamanto*).\n\n*Bhūrivijjā* means a mantra which should be learned while dwelling in a Bhūri house (*bhūrighare vasantena uggahetabbamanto*).\n\n*Ahivijjā* means the science of treating snake bites (*sappadaṭṭhatikicchanavijjā*), as well as the science of snake charming (*sappāvhāyanavijjā*).\n\n*Visavijjā*: By means of which they either protect old poison (*purāṇavisaṃ rakkhanti*), create new poison (*navavisaṃ karonti*), or simply make poisonless (*visavantameva vā*).\n\n*Vicchikavijjā* means the science of treating scorpion stings (*vicchikadaṭṭhatikicchanavijjā*).\n\nThe same rule applies to mouse-science (*mūsikavijjāyapi eseva nayo*).\n\n*Sakuṇavijjā* means bird-lore (*sakuṇañāṇaṃ*) based on the cries, gait, etc. of winged (*sapakkhaka*), wingless (*apakkhaka*), two-footed (*dvipada*), and four-footed (*catuppadānaṃ*) creatures.\n\n*Vāyasavijjā* means crow-cry-lore (*kākarutañāṇaṃ*); this is a separate science (*satthaṃ*), therefore it is stated separately.\n\n*Pakkajjhāna* means thought that has reached maturity (*paripākagatacintā*).\n\nNow, the meaning is that \"this one will live so long, that one so long,\" thus proceeding, is called knowledge of prediction (*ādiṭṭhañāṇanti attho*).\n\n*Saraparittāṇa* means protection from arrows (*sararakkhaṇaṃ*), such that the arrow does not come upon oneself; this is the science of repelling arrows (*karaṇavijjā*).\n\n*Migacakka* means this is all-inclusive, stated based on knowledge of the cries of all birds and quadrupeds (*idaṃ sabbasaṅgāhikaṃ sabbasakuṇacatuppadānaṃ rutañāṇavasena vuttaṃ*).",

    "commentary_english": "28. Having explained in detail the three classes of moral virtue as the sequel to the praise spoken by Brahmadatta, now, as the sequel to the praise spoken by the company of *bhikkhus*, the Exalted One begins the elucidation of emptiness with the words: “There are, *bhikkhus*, other *dharmas* deep, difficult to see,” and so forth.\n\nThere, \"*dhamma*\" means noble quality (*guṇa*), the teaching (*desanā*), the scriptures (*pariyatti*), impersonal states (*nissatta*), etc.; thus, the word *dhamma* is used.\n\nIn the passage, \"I will teach you the *Dhamma*, *bhikkhus*, good in the beginning,\" etc., it means the teaching.\n\nIn the passage, \"Herein, a *bhikkhu* masters the *Dhamma*—the *suttas*, songs,\" etc., it means the scriptures.\n\nAnd in the passage, “On that occasion there are *dharmas*, there are aggregates,\" etc., it means impersonal states.\n\nHere, it has the meaning of noble quality (*guṇa*).\n\nThus, the sentence means: “There are other noble qualities (*guṇa*) of the *Tathāgata*.\"\n\n\"*Gambhīrā*\" (deep): like the great ocean, where, with the needle-point beak of a mosquito, there is no place to get a footing for the knowledge of others except for the *Tathāgatas*; they are \"*duddasā*\" (difficult to see) because of their depth.\n\nThey are \"*duranubodhā*\" (difficult to understand) because they are \"*duddasattāyeva*\" (difficult to see).\n\nThey are \"*santā*\" (peaceful) because all the fevers of passion become pacified, or because they occur in regard to peaceful objects; \"*santārammaṇesu pavattanatopi santā*.\"\n\nThey are \"*paṇītā*\" (sublime) because one cannot be satiated with them, as with delicious food; \"*atittikaraṇaṭṭhena*.\"\n\nThey are \"*atakkāvacarā*\" (beyond the sphere of reasoning) because the objective domain of the uttermost knowledge cannot be encompassed by reasoning; \"*uttamañāṇavisayattā na takkena avacaritabbāti*.\"\n\n\"*Nipuṇāti*\" (subtle) because they are abstruse and recondite in nature; \"*saṇhasukhumasabhāvattā*.\"\n\nAnd they are \"*paṇḍitavedanīyā*\" (comprehensible only to the wise), that is, they must be understood by the wise, for they are not the objective domain of fools; \"*bālānaṃ avisayattā, paṇḍitehiyeva veditabbāti*.\"\n\n\"*Ye tathāgato sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedetīti ye dhamme tathāgato anaññaneyyo hutvā selama abhivisiṭṭhena ñāṇena paccakkhaṃ katvā pavedeti, dīpeti, katheti, pakāsetīti attho*\" (those things which the *Tathāgata* himself makes known, having directly experienced them with higher knowledge, means those *dharmas* which the *Tathāgata*, being unguided by another, himself directly makes known with outstanding knowledge, explains, declares, reveals); this is the meaning.\n\n\"*Yehīti yehi guṇadhammehi*\" (with which): with which noble qualities (*guṇadhamma*).\n\n\"*Yathābhuccanti yathābhūtaṃ*\" (as it really is): in accordance with reality.\n\n\"*Vaṇṇaṃ sammā vadamānā vadeyyunti tathāgatassa vaṇṇaṃ vattukāmā sammā vadeyyuṃ, ahāpetvā vattuṃ sakkuṇeyyunti attho*\" (speaking praise rightly, they should speak): those who desire to speak the praise of the *Tathāgata* should speak rightly, and they should be able to speak without depreciation; this is the meaning.\n\nWhat are these *dharmas* extolled in this way by the Blessed One (*bhagavatā*)? All-knowing knowledge (*sabbaññutañāṇaṃ*).\n\nIf so, why is it described in the plural? Because it is associated with multiple classes of consciousness and because it takes a multiplicity of objects on the successive occasions of its arising; \"*puthucittasamāyogato ceva, puthuārammaṇato ca*.\"\n\nFor the knowledge of omniscience is found in the four great functional classes of consciousness associated with knowledge, and there is no *dhamma* that is not an object of it; \"*tañhi catūsu ñāṇasampayuttamahākiriyacittesu labbhati, na cassa koci dhammo ārammaṇaṃ nāma na hoti*.\"\n\nAs it is said: “It knows the entire past, thus it is the knowledge of omniscience. It knows everything therein without obstruction, thus it is unobstructed knowledge” (*atītaṃ sabbaṃ jānātīti sabbaññutaññāṇaṃ, tattha āvaraṇaṃ natthīti anāvaraṇañāṇa*).\n\nThus, because it is associated with multiple classes of consciousness and because it takes a multiplicity of objects on the successive occasions of its arising, it is described in the plural; \"*iti puthucittasamāyogato punappunaṃ uppattivasena puthuārammaṇato ca bahuvacananiddeso katoti*.\"\n\n“*Aññevā*”: this is a term for distinguishing there: “different indeed, not abstaining from killing living beings, etc. (*na pāṇātipātā veramaṇiādayo*).\"\n\n\"*Gambhīrāva na uttānā*\": in this way, it should be connected with all the terms.\n\nIndeed, the knowledge consisting of the perfections of a disciple (*sāvakapāramīñāṇa*) is deep (*gambhīraṃ*), but the knowledge of a solitary Buddha (*paccekabodhiñāṇaṃ*) is deeper than that, but there is no distinction there; and all-knowing knowledge (*sabbaññutañāṇa*) is deeper than that, and there is no distinction even there; but there is nothing deeper than this; therefore, the distinction is obtained that they are deep.\n\nLikewise, everything should be understood as difficult to see and difficult to understand; \"*tathā duddasāva duranubodhā vāti sabbaṃ veditabbaṃ*.\"\nWhat are these factors, monks? This question expresses their desire to speak about these factors (dharma).\n\nThere are, monks, some recluses and brahmins, and so forth, a question and answer.\n\nWhy, then, has this been commenced in this way? Because on four occasions the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great, their knowledge enters its proper field, the greatness of the Buddha knowledge becomes manifest and their teaching becomes deep, stamped with the three characteristics, connected with emptiness.\n\nWhat are the four? The promulgation of the Vinaya (vinayapaññattiṃ), the classification of the diversity of planes (bhūmantaraṃ), the exposition of conditionality (paccayākāraṃ), and the classification of the diversity of creeds (samayantaranti).\n\nTherefore: “This is a light offense, this a heavy offense. This is curable, this incurable. This is an offense, this not an offense. This leads to expulsion, this to rehabilitation, this to confession. This is a fault according to the world, this according to the rules of the Order. In such a case, such should be promulgated.\" The “promulgation of the Discipline” is the promulgation of a training rule in a particular case which has arisen. In this matter others have neither the capacity nor the power; this is not the domain of others, it is the domain only of the Tathāgata.\n\nThus, in the promulgation of the Discipline (vinayapaññattiṃ), the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great, their knowledge enters its proper field, and so on, connected with emptiness.\n\nLikewise, these are the four foundations of mindfulness (satipaṭṭhānā nāma)... and so on... the Noble Eightfold Path (ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo nāma), the five aggregates (pañca khandhā nāma), the twelve sense bases (dvādasa āyatanāni nāma), the eighteen elements (aṭṭhārasa dhātuyo nāma), the four noble truths (cattāri ariyasaccāni nāma), the twenty-two faculties (bāvīsatindriyāni nāma), the nine causes (nava hetū nāma), the four kinds of nutriment (cattāro āhārā nāma), the seven contacts (satta phassā nāma), the seven feelings (satta vedanā nāma), the seven perceptions (satta saññā nāma), the seven volitions (satta cetanā nāma), the seven types of consciousness (satta cittāni nāma).\n\nAmong these, so many factors (dharma) pertain to the sense sphere (kāmāvacarā dhammā nāma), so many factors pertain to the fine-material and immaterial spheres (rūpāvacaraarūpāvacarapariyāpannā dhammā nāma), so many factors are mundane (lokiyā dhammā nāma), so many factors are supramundane (lokuttarā dhammā nāmāti). Others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain this matter, for this is not the domain of others; it is the domain only of the Tathāgata in the twenty-four fold universal pattern (catuvīsatisamantapaṭṭhānaṃ) of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka (abhidhammapiṭakaṃ) with its infinite methods (anantanayaṃ).\n\nThus, in the classification of the diversity of planes (bhūmantaraparicchedaṃ), the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great, their knowledge enters its proper field, and so on, connected with emptiness.\n\nLikewise, this ignorance (avijjā) is a condition (paccayo) for the formations (saṅkhārānaṃ) in nine ways (navahākārehi): being a condition as arising (uppādo hutvā paccayo hoti), being a condition as occurrence (pavattaṃ hutvā), sign (nimittaṃ), accumulation (āyūhanaṃ), conjunction (saṃyogo), impediment (palibodho), origination (samudayo), cause (hetu), and condition (paccayo hutvā paccayo hoti). Likewise, the formations (saṅkhārādayo) are conditions for consciousness (viññāṇādīnaṃ).\n\nAs it was said: “How is wisdom (paññā) in the discernment of conditions (paccayapariggahe) the knowledge of the structure of dhammas (dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaṃ)? Ignorance (avijjā) is the basis for kamma-formations (saṅkhārānaṃ), as the arising (uppādaṭṭhiti ca), occurrence (pavattaṭṭhiti ca), sign (nimittaṭṭhiti  ca), accumulation (āyūhanaṭṭhiti ca), conjunction (saṃyogaṭṭhiti ca), impediment (palibodhaṭṭhiti ca), origination (samudayaṭṭhiti ca), cause (hetuṭṭhiti ca), and condition (paccayaṭṭhiti ca) for kamma-formations. Ignorance (avijjā) is a condition (paccayo) in these nine modes (imehi navahākārehi), the kamma-formations (saṅkhārā) are conditionally arisen (paccayasamuppannā), both these dhammas (ubhopete dhammā) are conditionally arisen (paccayasamuppannāti). This is wisdom (paññā) in the discernment of conditions (paccayapariggahe), the knowledge of the structure of dhammas (dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaṃ).\n\nIn the past (atītampi addhānaṃ), and also in the future (anāgatampi addhānaṃ), ignorance (avijjā) is the condition for kamma formations (saṅkhārānaṃ) as arising... and so on... birth (jāti) is the condition for aging and death (jarāmaraṇassa) as arising ...and so on... and condition. Birth (jāti) is a condition (paccayo) in these nine modes (imehi navahākārehi), aging and death (jarāmaraṇaṃ) are conditionally arisen (paccayasamuppannaṃ), both these dhammas (ubhopete dhammā) are conditionally arisen (paccayasamuppannāti). This is wisdom (paññā) in the discernment of conditions (paccayapariggahe), the knowledge of the structure of dhammas (dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaṃ).\" (Paṭi., Ma., 1.45).\n\nIn this way, others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain this matter, for this is not the domain of others; it is the domain only of the Tathāgata, for this arising of this and that dhamma (evamimaṃ tassa tassa dhammassa), in such and such a condition (tathā tathā paccayabhāvena), the continuity (pavattaṃ), threefold round (tivaṭṭaṃ), threefold duration (tiyaddhaṃ), threefold connection (tisandhiṃ), fourfold section (catusaṅkhepaṃ), twentyfold mode (vīsatākāraṃ) of dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppādaṃ). Thus, in the exposition of conditionality (paccayākāraṃ), the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great, their knowledge enters its proper field, and so on, connected with emptiness.\n\nLikewise, there are four kinds of eternalists (sassatavādā nāma), four kinds of partial eternalists (ekaccasassatavādā), four kinds of extensionists (antānantikā), four kinds of endless equivocators (amarāvikkhepikā), two kinds of fortuitous originationists (adhiccasamuppannikā), sixteen who hold doctrines of percipient immortality (saññīvādā), eight who hold doctrines of non-percipient immortality (asaññīvādā), eight who hold doctrines of neither percipient nor non-percipient immortality (nevasaññīnāsaññīvādā), seven kinds of annihilationists (ucchedavādā), and five kinds of present-life Nibbāna-ists (diṭṭhadhammanibbānavādā nāma).\n\nDepending on this, they assume this. Others have neither the capacity nor the power to explain these sixty-two speculative views (dvāsaṭṭhi diṭṭhigatāni), breaking them down (bhinditvā) into a state free from entanglement (nijjaṭaṃ) and free from thickets (niggumbaṃ), for this is not the domain of others; it is the domain only of the Tathāgata.\n\nThus, in the classification of the diversity of creeds (samayantaraṃ), the thundering of the Buddhas becomes truly great, their knowledge enters its proper field, the greatness of the Buddha-knowledge is discerned, and their teaching becomes deep, stamped with the three characteristics, connected with emptiness.\n\nIn this place (imasmiṃ pana ṭhāne), the classification of the diversity of creeds (samayantaraṃ) is found (labbhati). Therefore, in order to show the greatness of his knowledge of omniscience (sabbaññutaññāṇassa mahantabhāvadassanatthaṃ), and in order to give, through the discourse (desanāya ca), an explication and elucidation of emptiness (suññatāpakāsanavibhāvanatthaṃ), the King of the Dhamma (dhammarājā), entering into the diversity of creeds (samayantaraṃ anupavisanto), begins his answer to the question with the words: \"There are, monks, some recluses and brahmins (santi, bhikkhave, eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā),\" and so forth, a question and answer (evaṃ pucchāvissajjanaṃ ārabhi).",

Such is the meaning.\n\nBy both, he shows the indestructibility of the world ( *loka*).\n\nBut some, saying the text is *īsikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*, say that it stands like a reed (*īsikā*) in *muñja* grass.\n\nThe meaning there is this: that which is said to be born (*jāyatīti*), emerges as something already existing, like a reed (*īsikā*) from *muñja* grass.\n\nAnd because it stands like a pillar (*īsikaṭṭhāyiṭṭhito*), therefore those beings wander on, from here going elsewhere. Such is the meaning.\n\n*Saṃsarantīti* means wander about from one to another (*aparāparaṃ sañcaranti*).\n\n*Cavantīti* means they go to reckoning (*evaṃ saṅkhyaṃ gacchanti*).\n\nLikewise, they come to be (*tathā upapajjantīti*).\n\nIn the *Aṭṭhakathā*, however, having previously said, \"The self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal\" (*sassato attā ca loko cā*), now by the statement beginning with \"and those beings wander on\" (*te ca sattā sandhāvantīti*), this adherent to a view, by his own self, undermines his own doctrine ( *vādaṃ bhindati*); the vision of the adherent to a view is not consistent; it is fickle like a stake implanted in a heap of chaff; in the basket of a madman, there is both beautiful and unbeautiful, like pieces of cake, excrement, cow dung, etc., thus it is said.\n\n\"*Atthitveva sassatisamanti*,\" here, *sassatīti* means he thinks of the great earth as being constantly present, and likewise Mount Sumeru, the moon, and the sun.\n\nThen, conceiving the self (*attānaṃ*) to be equal to them, they say, \"*Atthi tveva sassatisamanti*.\"\n\nNow, showing the reason for the purpose of proving the assertion beginning with \"The self (*attā*) and the world (*loka*) are eternal\" (*sassato attā ca loko cāti*), he says, \"What is the reason? Because I follow ātappa.\"\n\nThere, \"By this I know this\" means by this special attainment, I know this directly; he shows that he does not speak from mere faith alone. The *ma* is said here for the purpose of connecting the words.\n\nBhikkhus, this is the first case, and in the four cases spoken of by the word \"ground\" (*vatthu*), this is the first case; this recollection of hundreds of thousands of births is the first cause.

The *Tathāgata* does not understand only this fourfold speculative view together with its grounds and destinations, but he understands all that, and he understands what transcends it; that is, virtue (*śīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), and the knowledge of omniscience (*sarvajñuta-jñāna*).\n\nYet even that understanding he does not misapprehend. Although he understands such incomparable states of distinction, he does not think, \"I understand this,\" etc., misapprehending it by way of craving (*tṛṣṇā*), views (*dṛṣṭi*), and conceit (*māna*).\n\n\"And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nirvṛti*).\" With non-misapprehension as a condition, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace (*nirvṛti*), the pacification of the defilements (*kleśa*) of misapprehension.\n\nHe shows: \"Monks, *Nirvāṇa* is evident to the *Tathāgata*.\"\n\nNow, in order to show the practice by means of which he, the *Tathāgata*, achieved that perfect peace (*nirvṛti*), the *Tathāgata*, explaining the meditation subject in terms of those very feelings enamored with which the sectarians (*tīrthika*) enter the jungle of views, thinking, \"Here we shall be happy! We shall be happy here!\" begins by saying, \"The arising of feelings,\" and so forth.\n\n\"Having understood as they really are…\": \"With the arising of ignorance (*avidyā*), there is the arising of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned origination; \"with the arising of craving (*tṛṣṇā*), there is the arising of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned origination; \"with the arising of *karma*, there is the arising of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned origination; \"with the arising of contact (*sparśa*), there is the arising of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned origination.\n(Paṭisambhidāmagga.\nMahāvagga.\n1.\n50)\n\n\"Seeing as well the characteristic of production, he sees the rise of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*).\" Having understood as it really is the origin of feelings (*vedanā*) by way of these five characteristics: \"With the cessation of ignorance (*avidyā*), there is the cessation of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned cessation; \"with the cessation of craving (*tṛṣṇā*), there is the cessation of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned cessation; \"with the cessation of *karma*, there is the cessation of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned cessation; \"with the cessation of contact (*sparśa*), there is the cessation of feelings (*vedanā*)\"—he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*) in the sense of its conditioned cessation.\n\n\"Seeing as well the characteristic of change, he sees the fall of the aggregate of feelings (*vedanā-skandha*).\"\n(Paṭisambhidāmagga.\nMahāvagga.\n1.\n50) Having understood as it really is the passing away of feelings (*vedanā*) by way of these five characteristics, [he further understands]: \"The pleasure (*sukha*) and joy (*saumanasya*) that arise in dependence on feelings (*vedanā*), this is the satisfaction (*āsvāda*) in feelings (*vedanā*).\"\n(Saṃyutta Nikāya.\nNidāna Vagga.\n3.\n26) Thus, having understood as it really is the satisfaction (*āsvāda*), [he further understands]: \"That feelings (*vedanā*) are impermanent (*anitya*), suffering (*duḥkha*), subject to change (*vipariṇāma-dharma*), this is the unsatisfactoriness (*ādīnava*) in feelings (*vedanā*).\" Thus, having understood as it really is the unsatisfactoriness (*ādīnava*), [he further understands]: \"The abandonment of desire (*chanda*) and passion (*rāga*) with regard to feelings (*vedanā*), the giving up of desire (*chanda*) and passion (*rāga*), this is the escape (*niḥsaraṇa*) from feelings (*vedanā*).\" Thus, having understood as it really is the escape (*niḥsaraṇa*), because of the absence of desire (*chanda*) and passion (*rāga*), the *Tathāgata*, monks, is without grasping (*anupādāna*), liberated through non-grasping (*anupādā-vimutta*); if there were any grasping (*upādāna*), he would grasp at something, and because of grasping there would be an aggregate (*skandha*); because of the absence of that, without grasping at any *dharma* (*dharma*), the *Tathāgata*, monks, is liberated.",

When the force of the *jhāna* is exhausted, the aggregate of material form disappears there and a rebirth-linking perception (*pratisaṃdhi-saṃjñā*) arises here.\n\nBecause their passing away from the non-percipient realm is discerned through the arising of perception here, it is said: “When perception arises in them, those gods pass away from that plane.”\n\n*Santatāyāti* means to the state of continuousness.\n\nThe rest is evident.\n\nThe argument based on reasoning ( *takkīvāda* ) should be understood just as has been said.",

What self (*kamattānaṃ*), then, will actions (*kammāni*) done by the not-self (*anattakatāni*) affect?”\n\nThen the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), knowing with his mind (*cetasā*) the thought in the mind (*ceto*) of that *bhikkhu* (monk), addressed the *bhikkhus* (monks) thus: “It is possible (*ṭhānaṃ*), *bhikkhus* (monks), that some misguided man (*moghapuriso*) here, obtuse (*avidvā*) and ignorant (*avijjāgato*), with his mind (*cetasā*) dominated by craving (*taṇhādhipateyyena*) might think that he can outstrip (*atidhāvitabbaṃ maññeyya*) the Teacher’s Dispensation (*satthusāsanaṃ*) thus: ‘So, it seems, material form (*rūpaṃ*) is not self (*anattā*)… what self (*phusissantī*)?”\n\n“What do you think (*maññatha*), *bhikkhus* (monks), is material form (*rūpaṃ*) permanent (*niccaṃ*) or impermanent (*aniccaṃ*)?” (Ma. Ni. 3. 10).\n\nThus, having understood the inclinations (*ajjhāsayaṃ*) of others, the “sequence of meaning dictated by inclination” (*ajjhāsayānusandhi*) can be understood through those suttas (*vuttasuttavasena*) the Exalted One pronounced (*bhagavatā*).\n\nThe “sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure of the teaching” (*yathānusandhi*) can be understood through those suttas in which the teaching (*desanā*) progresses from its initial subject to its culmination by way of counterparts (*anurūpadhamma*), or by way of the opposites (*paṭipakkha*) of the initial subject.\n\nFor example, in the Ākaṅkheyya Sutta the teaching (*desanā*) is set up at the beginning by way of virtue (*sīlena*) and culminates in the six kinds of direct knowledge (*cha abhiññā*).\n\nIn the Vattha Sutta, the teaching (*desanā*) is set up by way of the defilements (*kilesena*) and culminates in the sublime abodes (*brahmavihārā*).\n\nIn the Kosambiya Sutta, the teaching (*desanā*) is set up by way of schism (*bhaṇḍanena*) and culminates in the principles of fraternal harmony (*sāraṇīyadhammā*).\n\nIn the Kakacūpama, the teaching (*desanā*) is set up at the beginning by way of patience (*akkhantiyā*) and culminates in the Kakacūpama.\n\nAnd in this Brahmajāla Sutta, the teaching (*desanā*) is set up at the beginning by way of views (*diṭṭhivasena*) and culminates in the elucidation of emptiness (*suññatāpakāsanaṃ*).\n\nThus it is said: “This teaching (*desanā*) has come down by way of a sequence of meaning dictated by the natural structure (*yathānusandhivasena*) of the teaching.",

    "commentary_english": "144. Now, in this context, *bhikkhus*, those recluses and *brāhmaṇas* who are eternalists and propound the self (*ātman*) and the world to be eternal based on four grounds, and those recluses and *brāhmaṇas* who gather together all the feelings of views according to the method beginning with the partial-eternalists, etc.\n\nWhy? In order to relate them once more to contact.\n\nHow? All of them experience these feelings only by repeated contacts through the six sense-bases (*phassāyatana*).\n\nTherein, the six sense-bases (*phassāyatana*) are: the eye as a sense-base (*cakkhuphassāyatana*), the ear as a sense-base, the nose as a sense-base, the tongue as a sense-base, the body as a sense-base, and the mind as a sense-base. These are the six.\n\nThe word \"base\" (*āyatana*) occurs in the texts with four meanings: place of origin (*sañjāti*), place of convergence (*samosaraṇa*), cause (*kāraṇa*), and as a mere designation of place (*paṇṇattimatta*).\n\nFor example, in the statement: “Kamboja is the base for horses, the southern region the base for cows,” it signifies place of origin; that is, the meaning is place of origin.\n\n“The birds resort to that delightful base” signifies place of convergence.\n\n“When there is a basis” signifies cause.\n\n“They dwell in leaf huts in the forest base” signifies a mere designation.\n\nIn the present case, the first three meanings apply.\n\nFor the pentad of contact originates in and converges upon the sense faculties, and these latter are its cause; thus they are called \"bases\" (*āyatana*).\n\nHere, the bases of contact, etc., are mentioned in order to show the succession of conditions, making contact the starting point and arranging the teaching under the heading of contact, in accordance with the method of the following passage: “Dependent on the eye and visible forms (*rūpa*), eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact (*phassa*),” etc.\n\n\"They experience these feelings by repeated contacts\" means they experience these feelings by contacting again and again.\n\nAlthough the statement \"by repeated contacts through the six bases of contact\" gives the impression that the six bases themselves exercise the function of contacting, this would be a wrong interpretation.\n\nFor it is not the bases (*āyatana*) that contact, rather, it is contact (*phassa*) itself that contacts the various objects (*ārammaṇa*). The bases (*āyatana*) are shown as incorporated within contact. Therefore, the meaning of the present passage should be understood thus: \"All these recluses and *brāhmaṇas* experience the feeling of views by contacting objects such as visible forms (*rūpa*), etc., by means of contact (*phassa*) originating through the six sense-bases (*phassāyatana*).\"\n\nWith feeling (*vedanā*) as condition, there arises in them craving (*taṇhā*). \"Feeling\" (*vedanā*) is here the feeling originating through the six sense-bases (*phassāyatana*).\n\nIt is a condition for craving (*taṇhā*)—divided into craving for visible forms (*rūpa*), etc.—under the crest of decisive support condition.\n\nThus it is said: \"With feeling (*vedanā*) as condition, there arises in them craving (*taṇhā*).\"\n\nCraving (*taṇhā*) in turn is a condition for the four types of clinging (*upādāna*) under the crests of decisive-support and co-nascence.\n\nClinging (*upādāna*) is a condition for existence (*bhava*) in the same way.\n\nExistence (*bhava*) is a condition for birth (*jāti*) under the crest of decisive-support.\n\n\"Birth\" (*jāti*) here is the five aggregates (*pañcakkhandha*) together with their alterations. Birth (*jāti*) is a condition for aging (*jarā*) and death (*maraṇa*), and for sorrow (*śoka*), etc., under the crest of decisive-support.\n\nThis is a brief explanation. The detailed explanation can be found in the discussion of dependent origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*) in the *Visuddhimagga*.\n\nBut what is given here is sufficient.\n\nWhen he gives an exposition of the round, the Exalted One sometimes discusses it under the heading of ignorance (*avidyā*), as when he says: “No first beginning of ignorance (*avidyā*) is made known, *bhikkhus*, before which there was no ignorance (*avidyā*), and after which there came to be ignorance (*avidyā*). And while it is said thus, *bhikkhus*, nevertheless it is made known that ignorance (*avidyā*) has its specific condition”;\n61) Thus, or under the heading of ignorance (*avijjāsīsena*), bhikkhus, no first limit (*purimā koṭi*) of craving for existence (*bhavataṇhāya*) is discernible…etc.… \"Craving for existence has this as its condition (*idappaccayā bhavataṇhā*)” (A.\nN.\n10)\n62) Thus, or under the heading of craving (*taṇhāsīsena*), bhikkhus, no first limit (*purimā koṭi*) of views about existence (*bhavadiṭṭhiyā*) is discernible…etc.… \"Views about existence have this as their condition (*idappaccayā bhavadiṭṭhī*)” Thus, or under the heading of views (*diṭṭhisīsena*), he spoke.\n\nHere, discussing under the heading of views (*diṭṭhisīsena*), having spoken of the views (*diṭṭhiyo*) that arise from lust for feeling (*vedanārāgena*), he spoke of dependent origination (*paṭiccasamuppādaṃ*) rooted in feeling (*vedanāmūlakaṃ*).\n\nTherefore, he shows this: “These adherents to views (*diṭṭhigatikā*), having taken up this view (*dassanaṃ gahetvā*), wander and transmigrate (*sandhāvantā saṃsarantā*) through the three existences (*tīsu bhavesu*), the four modes of generation (*catūsu yonīsu*), the five destinations (*pañcasu gatīsu*), the seven abodes of consciousness (*sattasu viññāṇaṭṭhitīsu*), and the nine abodes of beings (*navasu sattāvāsesu*), from here to there and from there to here, like an ox yoked (*yuttagoṇo*) to a yoke, like a dog tied (*upanibaddhakukkuro*) to a post (*thambhe*), or like a ship with a broken mast (*vippannaṭṭhanāvā*) in the wind, they revolve in the round of suffering (*vaṭṭadukkhameva anuparivattanti*), and are not able (*na sakkontī*) to lift their heads (*sīsaṃ ukkhipituṃ*) out of the round of suffering (*vaṭṭadukkhato*).\"",

    "commentary_english": "147. Thus, having shown that because their views are all included in these sixty-two views, all the theorists are included in the net of this teaching, the Exalted One, showing that he himself is not contained anywhere, makes the above statement: “The body of the *Tathāgata*, monks, has the 'leash of existence' cut off.\"\n\nThere, they lead by this, thus it is called a *netti* (leash).\n\nBecause they lead [an animal] along after tying it around his neck, it is called by this name, *rajju*.\n\nHere, craving for existence (*bhava-taṇhā*) is intended by the word “leash” (*netti*), since such craving is similar to a leash.\n\nThat which, having bound a great mass of people by the neck, leads them to various states of existence, that is why it is called \"leash of existence\" (*bhava-netti*).\n\nBecause the *Tathāgata* has the \"leash of existence\" (*bhava-netti*) cut off with the sword of the path of *arhatship*, therefore, [his body] is \"with the leash of existence cut off\" (*ucchinnabhavanettiko*).\n\n\"Ascending from the dissolution of the body\" means ascending beyond the dissolution of the body.\n\n“The exhaustion of the life-faculty (*jīvita-pariyādāna*)” means because of the total exhaustion and cessation of the life faculty, there is no further rebirth-linkage; this is the meaning.\n\n\"They shall see him no more\" means they will not see that *Tathāgata*.\n\n\"Gods or humans shall see him no more\" because he will go to the state of non-apprehension; this is the meaning.\n\nJust as, monks, this application is an analogy.\n\nThe body of the *Tathāgata* is like the mango tree. The craving that occurred in the past supported by that body is like the great stalk (*mahāvaṇṭa*) growing on the tree.\n\nLike the bunch of mangoes (*amba-piṇḍī*) connected to the stalk (*vaṇṭa*), numbering five, twelve, or eighteen fruits, are the five aggregates (*pañcakkhandhā*), twelve bases (*dvādasāyatanāni*), and eighteen elements (*aṭṭhārasa dhātuyo*) connected with craving (*taṇhā*), which would have been produced in the future if craving were to continue to exist.\n\nBut just as, when the stalk (*vaṇṭa*) is cut, all those mangoes (*ambāni*) follow along with and accompany the stalk, and with the cutting off of the stalk are also cut off; this is the meaning. In the same way, all those *dharmas*—the five aggregates (*pañcakkhandhā*), twelve bases (*dvādasāyatanāni*), and eighteen elements (*aṭṭhārasadhātuyo*)—that would have arisen in the future if the stalk (*vaṇṭa*) of the \"leash of existence\" (*bhava-netti*) were not cut off, all follow along with and accompany the \"leash of existence\" (*bhava-netti*); when the leash is cut, they also are cut; this is the meaning.\n\nJust as, when the tree is gradually withered and killed by contact with a poisonous *maṇḍuka* thorn, no one sees the tree anymore, but people say; “In this place such and such a tree stood,\" using the word “tree” as a mere expression. In the same way, when the body of the *Tathāgata*, brought into contact with the noble paths, is gradually withered and broken up through the exhaustion of the moisture of craving (*taṇhā-sineha*), with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life- faculty (*jīvita-pariyādāna*), they shall see him no more. Neither gods nor men shall see that *Tathāgata*. \"This is the teaching of such and such a teacher,\" there will be only a mere expression.

there is no other path called *maggo* apart from the parts.\n\nTherefore, he said, \"That is to say, right view...pe...right concentration.\" (seyyathidaṃ, sammādiṭṭhi…pe… sammāsamādhī).\n\nHerein, right view (sammādiṭṭhi) is characterized by right seeing.\n\nRight intention (sammāsaṅkappo) is characterized by right application [of the mind].\n\nRight speech (sammāvācā) is characterized by right acceptance.\n\nRight action (sammākammanto) is characterized by right origination.\n\nRight livelihood (sammāājīvo) is characterized by right cleansing.\n\nRight effort (sammāvāyāmo) is characterized by right exertion.\n\nRight mindfulness (sammāsati) is characterized by right establishment.\n\nRight concentration (sammāsamādhi) is characterized by right steadiness.\n\nAmong these, each has three functions.\n\nThat is to say, right view, indeed, abandons wrong view (micchādiṭṭhi) together with the other defilements that are its adversaries; it makes cessation (nirodha) its object; and it sees the associated phenomena without confusion (asammohato) by dispelling the delusion (moha) that obscures them.\n\nLikewise, right intention (sammāsaṅkappo) and the others abandon wrong intention and so on; they make cessation their object; and in particular, right intention applies itself to the co-arisen phenomena.\n\nRight speech rightly accepts.\n\nRight action rightly originates.\n\nRight livelihood rightly cleanses.\n\nRight effort rightly exerts.\n\nRight mindfulness rightly establishes.\n\nRight concentration rightly steadies.\n\nMoreover, this right view, in the prior part, has diverse moments and diverse objects; in the moment of the path (maggakkhaṇe), it has a single moment and a single object.\n\nHowever, in terms of function (kiccato), it obtains four names, beginning with \"knowledge of suffering\" (dukkhe ñāṇa).\n\nRight intention and the others also have diverse moments and diverse objects in the prior part.\n\nIn the moment of the path, it has a single moment and a single object.\n\nAmong these, right intention, in terms of function, obtains three names, beginning with \"intention of renunciation\" (nekkhammasaṅkappo).\n\nRight speech and the other three are also abstinences (viratiyo), and they are also volitions (cetanādayo); however, in the moment of the path, they are only abstinences.\n\nThis pair, right effort and right mindfulness, also obtain four names in terms of function, as right exertion and mindfulness.\n\nRight concentration, however, is right concentration both in the prior part and in the moment of the path.\n\nThus, among these eight factors (dhammesu), because of the great benefit (bahukārattā) to the yogi who has embarked upon the attainment of *nirvāṇa*, right view (sammādiṭṭhi) was taught first by the Blessed One (bhagavatā).\n\nFor it is said to be \"the lamp of wisdom, the weapon of wisdom.\"\n\nTherefore, by means of this right view, reckoned as the knowledge of insight (vipassanāñāṇa) in the prior part, the yogāvacara, dispelling the darkness of ignorance (avijjandhakāraṃ), slaying the thieves of defilements (kilesacore ghātento), attains *nirvāṇa* safely.\n\nTherefore, it was said, \"Because of the great benefit to the yogi who has embarked upon the attainment of *nirvāṇa*, right view was taught first.\"\n\nRight intention, however, is of great benefit to that, therefore it was mentioned immediately after.\n\nJust as a goldsmith, turning a *kahāpaṇa* over and over in his hand, examines it with his eye, knowing, \"This is genuine, this is counterfeit,\"\n\nso too, the yogāvacara, pondering with thought (vitakkena vitakketvā) in the prior part, examining with the wisdom of insight (vipassanāpaññāya), understands, \"These phenomena are of the sense-sphere, these phenomena are of the form-sphere, and so on.\"\n\nOr just as a carpenter, having received a large tree given to him after a man has turned it over and over, taking it by the end, shapes it with an axe and applies it to his work, so too, the yogāvacara, having pondered with thought (vitakkena vitakketvā) the phenomena given to him, distinguishing with wisdom, \"These are of the sense-sphere, these are of the form-sphere,\" and so on, applies them to his work.\n\nTherefore, it was said, \"Right intention, however, is of great benefit to that, therefore it was mentioned immediately after.\"\nJust as right view is helpful, so too is right speech.\n\nAs it is said: \"First, having thought and reflected, afterwards one utters speech,\" (M.\n\nN.\n\n1.\n\n463) Therefore, right speech is stated immediately after that.\n\nSince people first make an agreement in speech, saying \"We will do this and that,\" and then apply themselves to actions in the world; therefore, because speech is helpful to bodily action, right action is stated immediately after right speech.\n\nSince, having abandoned the four kinds of verbal misconduct and the three kinds of bodily misconduct, one fulfills both kinds of good conduct, one fulfills the eightfold path of livelihood, not another; therefore, right livelihood is stated immediately after those two.\n\nThus, with purified livelihood, it is not fitting to be content with merely thinking, \"My livelihood is purified,\" and to live with scattered mindfulness, but to show that \"this effort should be undertaken in all activities,\" right effort is stated immediately after that.\n\nThen, in order to show that \"even with aroused effort, mindfulness should be well established in the four foundations of mindfulness, beginning with the body,\" right mindfulness is taught immediately after that.\n\nSince, when mindfulness is thus well established, it is possible to investigate the tendencies of dharmas that are helpful and unhelpful to *samādhi*, and to concentrate the mind on a single object, therefore it should be understood that right *samādhi* is taught immediately after right mindfulness.\n\n\"For the realization of these *dharmas*\": for the purpose of directly experiencing these fruits, beginning with stream-entry.",

The path is *aṭṭhaṅgika* as it is merely eight parts, and there is no other path apart from the parts.\n\nTherefore, he said, \"That is to say, right view…right concentration.\"\n\nHerein, right view (sammādiṭṭhi) has the characteristic of right seeing.\n\nRight intention (sammāsaṅkappa) has the characteristic of right directing.\n\nRight speech (sammāvācā) has the characteristic of right grasping.\n\nRight action (sammākammanta) has the characteristic of right establishing.\n\nRight livelihood (sammāājīva) has the characteristic of right cleansing.\n\nRight effort (sammāvāyāma) has the characteristic of right exertion.\n\nRight mindfulness (sammāsati) has the characteristic of right establishing.\n\nRight concentration (sammāsamādhi) has the characteristic of right composing.\n\nEach of these has three functions.\n\nThat is to say, right view, first of all, abandons wrong view (micchādiṭṭhi) along with other defilements (kilesa) that are its adversaries, makes cessation (nirodha) its object (ārammaṇa), and sees the associated phenomena without confusion (asammohato) by eliminating the delusion (moha) that conceals it.\n\nLikewise, right intention and the others abandon wrong intention (micchāsaṅkappa) and the others, and make cessation their object. However, in this case, right intention especially directs towards co-arisen phenomena.\n\nRight speech rightly grasps.\n\nRight action rightly establishes.\n\nRight livelihood rightly cleanses.\n\nRight effort rightly exerts.\n\nRight mindfulness rightly establishes.\n\nRight concentration rightly composes.\n\nMoreover, this right view, in the prior stage, has diverse moments and diverse objects, but in the moment of the path (maggakkhaṇe), it has a single moment and a single object.\n\nIn terms of function, it obtains four names, such as \"knowledge of suffering (dukkhe ñāṇa).\"\n\nRight intention and the others also have diverse moments and diverse objects in the prior stage.\n\nIn the moment of the path, it has a single moment and a single object.\n\nAmong these, right intention obtains three names in terms of function, such as \"intention of renunciation (nekkhammasaṅkappo).\"\n\nRight speech and the other three are also abstinences (virati), and they are also volitions (cetanā), but in the moment of the path, they are only abstinences.\n\nThis pair, right effort and right mindfulness, also obtain four names in terms of function, as right effort and mindfulness, respectively.\n\nRight concentration, however, is right concentration in both the prior stage and the moment of the path.\n\nThus, among these eight qualities, because the Blessed One greatly benefits the yogi who has embarked on attaining *nirvāṇa*, right view was taught first.\n\nFor this is also said to be \"the lamp of wisdom (paññāpajjoto), the sword of wisdom (paññāsattha).\" (Dha. Sa. 20)\n\nTherefore, by dispelling the darkness of ignorance (avijjandhakāra) with this right view, which in the prior stage is reckoned as the knowledge of insight (vipassanāñāṇa), and by slaying the thieves of defilements, the yogāvacara attains *nirvāṇa* safely.\n\nTherefore, it was said: \"Because the Blessed One greatly benefits the yogi who has embarked on attaining *nirvāṇa*, right view was taught first.\"\n\nRight intention, however, is of great benefit to that, therefore it was mentioned immediately after.\n\nJust as a goldsmith, turning and turning a coin in his hand, examining it with his eye, knows, \"This is genuine, this is counterfeit.\"\n\nSo also, the yogāvacara, reflecting and reflecting with thought in the prior stage, examining with insight-wisdom, understands, \"These phenomena belong to the realm of desire (kāmāvacarā), these phenomena belong to the realm of form (rūpāvacarā),\" and so on.\n\nOr, just as a carpenter, having been given a large tree that a man has turned and turned by grasping it at the end, planes it with an axe and puts it to work, so also the yogāvacara, having been given phenomena that have been thought about and thought about with thought, distinguishing with wisdom in the manner, \"These belong to the realm of desire, these belong to the realm of form,\" puts it to work.\n\nTherefore, it was said: \"Right intention, however, is of great benefit to that, therefore it was mentioned immediately after.\"\nJust as right view is helpful, so too is right speech.\n\nAs it was said: \"First, having thought and reflected, O Visākha, one then utters speech,\" (M.\nN.\n1.\n463) Therefore, right speech was stated after that.\n\nSince people first make an agreement in speech, saying \"We will do this and that,\" and then apply themselves to actions in the world, speech is helpful to bodily action; therefore, right action was stated after right speech.\n\nSince one who abandons the four kinds of verbal misconduct and the three kinds of bodily misconduct and fulfills both kinds of good conduct fulfills the eightfold means of livelihood, and not another, therefore, right livelihood was stated after those two.\n\nThus, with purified livelihood, it is not fitting to make contentment with \"My livelihood is purified\" and live heedlessly, but to show that \"This effort should be undertaken in all activities,\" right effort was stated after that.\n\nThen, \"Even with aroused effort, mindfulness should be well-established in the four foundations of mindfulness, beginning with the body,\" therefore, right mindfulness was taught after that, for the purpose of showing that.\n\nSince, with mindfulness thus well-established, one is able to investigate the courses of dharmas that are helpful and unhelpful to *samādhi* and to concentrate the mind on a single object, therefore, it should be understood that right *samādhi* was taught after right mindfulness.\n\n\"For the direct realization of these *dharmas*\" means for the purpose of the direct realization of the fruits of stream-entry and so forth.",

Having heard the elder's Dharma teaching, the five hundred monks were established in the fruit of stream-entry (sotāpatti-phala).\n\nThen Mahā Moggallāna, having shown them transformations again and again, taught them the Dharma. Having heard that, all were established in the fruit of Arhatship.\n\nThen the two great Nāgas, having taken the five hundred monks, ascended into the sky and came to Veḷuvana itself.\n\nThe miracle of instruction, however, is the constant teaching of the Dharma by the Buddhas. Among these, the miracles of psychic power and revelation are with effort (saupārambhāni) and with faults (sadosāni), they do not last long (addhānaṃ na tiṭṭhanti), and because they do not last long, they do not lead out (na niyyanti).\n\nThe miracle of instruction is without effort (anupārambhaṃ) and without faults (niddosaṃ), it lasts long (addhānaṃ tiṭṭhati), and because it lasts long, it leads out (niyyāti).\n\nTherefore, the Blessed One despises the miracle of psychic power and the miracle of revelation, and praises only the miracle of instruction.",

    "commentary_english": "150. Thus have I heard…pe… the Sāmaññaphala Sutta at Rājagaha.\n\nHere is an explanation of the first word: Rājagaha is the name of a city.\n\nIt is called Rājagaha because it was embraced by Mandhātu, Mahāgovinda, and others.\n\nOthers also explain it in other ways, but what is the use of that? This is merely the name of that city.\n\nIn the time of the Buddha and the time of the *cakravartin* (wheel-turning monarch) it was a city, but at other times it was empty, possessed by *yakṣas* (spirits), and remained a forest dwelling place for them.\n\n“Was living” signifies, without distinction, a possessor of one or other of the abidings consisting of the four postures and the three abidings consisting in the heavenly, the divine and the Noble Ones’ abidings.\n\nBut here it signifies occupation with one or other of the postures among those classed as standing, walking, sitting, and lying down.\n\nSo it can be understood that the Blessed One was so abiding either when standing or walking or seated or lying down.\n\nFor by terminating the discomfort of one posture by replacing it with one of the others, he carried his selfhood on, made it proceed onwards, without letting it fall; therefore it is called \"was living\".\n\n\"Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove\" signifies that he was living depending on a village that was his place of alms resort and signifies the place of dwelling near.\n\nTherefore, \"the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha, in Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove\" means it should be understood thus: he was living in Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove which was near Rājagaha.\n\nThe locative case is in the sense of ‘ vicinity’.\n\nThere, *jīvati* means *jīvaka* (living), raised by a prince, *kumārena bhata* means *komārabhacca*.\n\nAs he said: “I say, is this crowded with crows? Is the boy a god?\"\n\n“I say, is he alive?” “Yes, he’s alive.”\n\n“Well then, take him to our compound and give him to the wet-nurses to feed.”\n\nBecause it was said of him, “He’s alive,” they gave him the name ‘Jīvaka’ One who is alive.\n\n“Thus, as he was raised by the prince, they gave him the name Komārabhacca.”\n\n328) Here is a brief explanation.\n\nThe story of Jīvaka is related at length in the Khandhakas\n\nand explained in the Samantapāsādikā, the commentary to the Vinaya.\n\nOnce, when the Exalted One’s body was afflicted by a disorder of the humors, Jīvaka treated him with a purgative. He then gave the Buddha a pair of Siveyyaka cloths, and at the conclusion of the thanksgiving talk for the cloths, he was established in the fruit of stream-entry. Thereupon he thought: “I should go to wait upon the Buddha two or three times a day, but the Bamboo Grove is too far away. My park, the Mango Grove, is closer. Let me build a dwelling there for the Exalted One.”\n\nHe set up night- quarters, day-quarters, caves, huts, pavilions, etc, built a Fragrant Cottage suitable for the Exalted One, and erected a copper-colored wall eighteen yards high surrounding the Mango Grove. He treated the Sangha of *bhikkhus* (monks) headed by the Buddha to an offering of a meal and robes, and after pouring the gift-water, presented the dwelling.\n\nThat was referring to – \"Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s Mango Grove\".\n\n“With thirteen hundred and a half *bhikkhus*,” means with thirteen hundred *bhikkhus* less half a hundred.\n\nAmong the words beginning with \"king,\" \"king\" means one who pleases and increases the great multitude by his own majesty and the four bases of sympathy.\n\nThe lord of Magadha is called *māgadha* (Magadha).\n\nThe astrologers predicted: “Even while he is as yet unborn , he will be the king’s enemy ”; thus Ajātasattu, “unborn enemy.”\n\nIt is said that when he was still in his mother’s womb, the queen developed the compulsive urge to drink blood from the king’s right arm.She considered: “This compulsive urge that has arisen is terrible; I should not report it to anyone.” Being unable to express it, she became thin and pale.\n\nThe king asked her: “Dear, your body has become pallid. What is the reason?” “Don’t ask, great king.”\n\n—“Dear, if you don’t express your thoughts to me, to whom will you express them?” Urging her in various ways, he convinced her to speak.\n\nHaving heard, he said: “Dear, why do you regard this as terrible? ” He then sent for his physician, had him make an incision in his arm with a golden knife, collected the blood in a golden vessel, mixed it with water, and made her drink it.\n\nThe astrologers, hearing this, declared: “This child in her womb will be the king’s enemy.He will kill the king.”\n\nThe queen heard this and thought: “They say that when the child comes out from my belly he will kill the king.” Wishing to have an abortion, she went to the park and had her belly trampled upon, but abortion did not take place.\n\nShe went again and again and did the same thing.\n\nThe king inquired: “Why do you go to the park so often? ” Having learned the reason he said: “Dear, we do not even know whether you have a son or a daughter in your womb. If we do this to a child begotten by ourselves, a great calamity will appear in our land of India.Do not do so.” Having thus dissuaded her, he set a guard over her.\n\nWhen the child took birth she thought: “I will kill him,”\n\nbut guards took the child away from her.\n\nSome time later, after the prince had attained to growth, they showed him to the queen.\nWhen she saw him, maternal affection arose within her and she could not have him killed.\nEventually the king appointed his son viceroy.\nOne time Devadatta, while in seclusion, thought to himself: “Sāriputta has an assembly of followers, Mahāmoggallāna has an assembly of followers, Mahākassapa has an assembly of followers. Thus each of these maintains his own following. I, too, will gather a following.”\nHe considered: “It won’t be possible to acquire an assembly without gain. So let me obtain gain.” Then, as related in the Khandhakas, by means of the miracle of supernormal power he won the confidence of Prince Ajātasattu. The prince came to wait upon him morning and evening with five hundred chariots. Aware of his great trust, one day Devadatta approached the prince and said: “In the past, O prince, men lived long; now they are short-lived. Therefore, prince, you should kill your father and become king, and I will kill the Buddha and become a Buddha.” Thus he incited the prince to patricide.\nThe prince thought: “Master Devadatta has great spiritual power. There is nothing he does not know.” He fastened a dagger to his thigh and entered the inner palace in the middle of the day, but being fearful, apprehensive, alarmed and anxious, he muddled up the instructions he was given.\nThen the ministers, having arrested him and interrogated him, deciding that the prince should be killed along with Devadatta and all the *bhikkhus*, they reported the matter to the king intending to do whatever the king commanded.\nThe king demoted those ministers who wanted to kill the prince and Devadatta, and promoted those ministers who did not want to kill them. He asked the prince: “Prince, why do you want to kill me?” “Because, your majesty, I desire the kingdom.”\nThe king gave him his kingdom.\nWhen the prince reported to Devadatta that his wish had been granted,\nThen he said to him: “Like a man who beats the kettledrums after caging a jackal, you imagine you have finished your work. Within a few days your father, considering the contempt you have shown him, will himself become king.”\n“Then what should I do, venerable sir?” “Kill him at the root.”\n“But isn’t it true, venerable sir, that my father should not be killed by a weapon?” “Kill him by cutting off his food.”\nThe prince had his father thrown into the torture chamber, a smokehouse built for the purpose of inflicting punishment.\nHe said: “Do not let anyone see him except my mother.”\nThe queen put rice in a golden vessel and entered, bringing the vessel on her hip.\nThe king ate the rice and continued to live.\nThe prince asked him: “My father, how do you continue to live?” Having learned how, he ordered: “Do not let my mother enter bringing anything on her hip.”\nFrom then on the queen entered putting the vessel in her topknot.\nHaving learned about this, he ordered: “Do not let her enter with her hair bound in a topknot.”\nThen she put rice inside a pair of golden shoes, sealed the shoes, put them on, and entered.\nIn this way the king continued to live.\nAgain, the prince asked how he lived, and having learned how, he ordered: “Do not let her enter wearing shoes.”\nFrom then on the queen bathed with scented water, anointed her body with the four sweets (curd, honey, ghee, and molasses), dressed, and entered.\nThe king continued to live by licking her body.\nAgain the prince asked, and having heard the report, he ordered: “From now on prevent my mother from entering.”\nThe queen stood behind the door and cried out: “O, my husband Bimbisāra! You did not let me kill him in his infancy. You yourself nurtured your own enemy. This is the last time I will see you. From now on I will never see you again. If I have done anything wrong, please forgive me, my lord!” Weeping and wailing, she departed.\nFrom then on the king did not receive any food.\nThe king continued to live by walking back and forth in the happiness of the path and fruit.\nHis body became extremely radiant.\nThe prince asked: “Father, how do you continue to live?” Learning that he continued to live by walking back and forth, and seeing that this body had become extremely radiant, the prince thought: “Now I will prevent him from walking back and forth.” He ordered his barbers: “Cut open my father’s feet with a razor, smear them with salt and oil and roast them over flameless coals of acacia wood.”\nWhen the king saw the barbers, he thought: “Someone must have informed my son; they have come to trim my beard.”\nThey went to him, bowed down before him, and stood up.\nHe asked: “Why have you come here?” They reported their instructions.\nHe said: “You should do what your king commands.” They asked him to sit down, bowed to him, and said: “Your majesty, we are doing what the king has ordered us to do. Do not be angry at us. This isn’t proper for a righteous king such as yourself.” Then with the left hand they grabbed his ankles, with the right they took a razor, cut open his feet, smeared them with salt and oil, and roasted them over flameless coals of acacia wood.\nIt is said that the king, before, used to go to the *cetiya* terrace wearing shoes, and he stepped with unwashed feet on the *kaṭasāraka* mat that was laid out for sitting, therefore this happened.\nThe king experienced severe pain.\nWhile recollecting the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha he withered up like a garland of flowers thrown upon the terrace of a *cetiya*, and was reborn in the heavenly world of the Four Great Kings as a spirit named Janavasabha in the retinue of Vessavaṇa.\nThat same day a son was born to Ajātasattu. Two letters reached him simultaneously, one telling him of the birth of his son, the other of his father’s death.\nThe ministers, thinking: “First we will report to him the birth of his son,” handed him that letter.\nThe moment love for his newborn son arose in the king, shook his entire body, and penetrated through to the marrow of his bones.\nAt that moment he understood what it means to be a father, realizing, “When I was born, my own father felt such love for me.”\n\nHe said, “Go, men, release my father.”\n\nThey said, “How can we release him, your majesty?” and handed him the other letter.\n\nAs soon as he learned the news, he went weeping to his mother and asked her: “Mother, did my father feel love for me when I was born?” She said: “My foolish son, why do you say that? When you were a small child, a boil arose on your finger.\n\nYou kept on weeping and they couldn’t quiet you down, so they took you to your father, who was sitting in the judgement hall.\n\nYour father put your finger in his mouth,\n\nand the boil broke open right in his mouth.\n\nHe couldn’t spit out the pus and blood, so out of love for you, he swallowed them.\n\nSuch was your father’s love for you.”\n\nWeeping and lamenting, he disposed of his father’s body.\n\nDevadatta then approached Ajātasattu and told the king to order some men to assassinate the Buddha. He sent the men given to him . Then Devadatta ascended Vulture’s Peak himself and with a sling hurled a rock at the Buddha . He even had the elephant Nālāgiri let loose , but no matter what method he used, he could not kill the Exalted One. When his gains and honor had been lost, he asked the Buddha to accept his five proposals. 19 The Buddha did not agree, and Devadatta thought to use those points\n\nHe asked, “Where does the Teacher dwell now?” When they said, “In Jetavana,” he said, “Bring me there on a stretcher so I can see the Teacher.” As he was being carried , because he had not done a deed worthy of seeing the Blessed One, near the pond in Jetavana the earth split into two, he sank into the great hell.\n\nThis is a brief explanation.\n\nA detailed account is related in the *Khandhakas*.\n\nBut since it can all be construed in the way already stated, the detail is not given here.\n\nThus the king was named Ajātasattu because the astrologers predicted: “Even while he is as yet unborn, he will be the king’s enemy.”\n\nVedehiputta means that he was the son of the daughter of King Kosala, not of the King of Videha.\n\nBut *Vedehī* is a term for a wise woman.\n\nAs it is said: “Vedehikā the headwoman (MN.\n\n226), Venerable Ānanda, the sage of Videha” (SN.\n\n2.\n154).\n\nHere is the meaning of the expression: because one knows by it, it is called *veda*, that is, a term for knowledge.\n\nBecause she strives, exerts herself, and perseveres with knowledge, therefore she is *Vedehī*.\n\nThe son of Vedehī is Vedehiputta.\n\n*Tadahūti* means on that day, that is, on that day.\n\n*Uposatha* means that one dwells near to, meaning that one dwells possessing virtue or refraining from food.\n\nThis is the extraction of the meaning here: “Come, friend Kappina, let us go to the *uposatha*,” etc., the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha is the *uposatha*.\n\n“Thus the *uposatha* undertaken and observed with its eight factors,” etc. (AN 8.43), is virtue (*sīla*).\n\n“For the pure one there is always success, for the pure one the *uposatha* is always fruitful,” etc. (MN 1.79) is fasting (*upavāsa*).\n\n“*Uposatha* is the name of a Nāga king,” etc. (DN.\n2.\n246) Description (paññatti).\n“Monks, dwellings should not be fully occupied with monks on that uposatha day,” etc. (Mahāva.\n181) A day for observing the fast.\nHere, too, the same is intended.\nBut this is threefold through the distinction of the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days.\nTherefore, it is said \"fifteenth\" in order to prevent the exclusion of the two remaining days.\nIt was said thus: \"Because one observes the fast here, it is called *uposatha*.\"\n\"Komudī\" means belonging to the *kumuda* water lilies.\nAt that time, it is said, the *kumuda* water lilies are in full bloom; because they exist here, it is *komudī*.\n\"Cātumāsinī\" means belonging to the four months; because it is the end of four months, it is *cātumāsī*.\nHere, however, it is called *cātumāsinī*.\nBecause of the fullness of the month, because of the fullness of the seasons, because of the fullness of the year, it is full, completely full, therefore full (puṇṇā sampuṇṇāti puṇṇā).\nThe moon is called *mā*; because it is full here, it is the full moon (puṇṇamā).\nThus, in these two terms, puṇṇāya puṇṇamāyāti, the meaning should be understood.\n“Surrounded by the king’s ministers” means, the meaning is: surrounded by the king’s ministers in a night resembling this, with the quarters being washed by streams of milk issuing forth from silver pitchers, resembling silver palaces scattered with multitudes of garlands of pearls, excellent jasmine flowers, white cloths, and *kumuda* water lilies, resembling the full moon’s light, free from the four corruptions, illuminating the rising of the *prabhā*.\n“Gone above the best palace” means gone above the best palace.\nHe sits on a valuable, gold seat with a raised, white umbrella.\nWhy is he sitting? For the purpose of warding off sleep.\nFor this king, from the day he killed his father, \"I will lie down and sleep,\" as soon as his eyes were closed, he woke up crying as if struck by a hundred spears.\nWhen asked, \"What is this?\", he says, \"Nothing.\"\nThus, sleep is unpleasant for him; therefore, he sits for the purpose of warding off sleep.\nMoreover, on that day, a festival (nakkhatta) was proclaimed.\nThe entire city was sprinkled and swept, scattered with sand, the door of every house adorned with pitchers full of five-colored flowers and parched grain, every direction was beautified with raised flags and banners of various designs and rows of brightly shining lamps, crowded with a great mass of people experiencing the pleasure of the festival games in every street and at every crossroads.\nThus, they say that he sits because of the day of the festival.\nHowever, even after saying this, the conclusion was made: \"For the royal family, it is always a festival, but he is sitting only for the purpose of warding off sleep.\"\n\"He exclaimed the joyful exclamation\" means he uttered an exclamation, just as when oil cannot hold its measure, it drips away, that is called dripping away (avaseko).\nAnd as water cannot be contained by a pond, it overflows, that is called a flood (ogho); just so, when a joyful statement cannot be contained by the heart, having become excessive, without remaining inside, it bursts forth, that is called a joyful exclamation (udāna).\nThe meaning is, he utters a joyful statement of this kind.\n\"Dosina\" means free from faults; it means free from these five corruptions: clouds (abbhā), mist (mahikā), smoke (dhūmo), dust (rajo), and Rāhu.\nTherefore, the five words of praise beginning with \"ramaṇīyāti\".\nBecause it delights the mind of the great multitude, it is delightful (ramaṇīyā).\nBecause of being illuminated by the light of the moon free from the aforementioned faults, it is exceedingly beautiful, therefore, exquisite (abhirūpā).\nBecause it is proper to see, it is worth seeing (dassanīyā).\nBecause it pleases the mind, it is pleasing (pāsādikā).\nBecause it is proper for the characteristics of days and months to come into existence, it is characterized by such (lakkhaññā).\n\"Who will I eat today?\" means \"Who will I feed today?\"\nA *śramaṇa* or a *brāhmaṇa* means a *śramaṇa* because of calming demerit.\nA *brāhmaṇa* because of dispelling demerit.\n\"Whom do you serve?\" This is an expression of words, meaning: by hearing the sweet Dhamma from those who serve us by means of asking questions, the mind would be pleased.\nThus, the king gave a hint by this entire statement, performing an act to indicate a sign ( *obhāsanimittakammaṃ akāsi*).\n\nTo whom does he give it? To Jīvaka.\n\nFor what purpose? In order to see the Exalted One (*bhagavato dassanatthaṃ*).\n\nBut couldn’t he go to the Exalted One on his own to see him? Yes, he cannot.\n\nWhy? Because of his great crimes (*mahāparādhatāya*).\n\nFor his own father, who was a noble disciple (*ariyasāvako*) and a supporter (*upaṭṭhāko*) of the Exalted One, was killed, and he himself, relying on Devadatta, did much harm (*anatthamakāsi*) to the Exalted One. Thus, this is a great crime (*mahāparādho*), and because of this great crime (*mahāparādhatāya*) he cannot go on his own.\n\nBut Jīvaka was a supporter (*upaṭṭhāko*) of the Exalted One, so he gave a hint (*obhāsanimittakammaṃ akāsi*), thinking: “I will see the Exalted One, like his shadow.”\n\nDid Jīvaka understand that the king was giving him a hint (*obhāsanimittakammaṃ*)? Yes, he understood.\n\nThen why did he remain silent? In order to cut off interruptions (*vikkhepapacchedanatthaṃ*).\n\nFor in that assembly there were many supporters (*upaṭṭhākā bahū sannipatitā*) of the six teachers, and since those on whom they attend are untrained (*asikkhitānaṃ*), they themselves are not properly trained (*asikkhitāva*).\n\nIf I should begin to speak about the virtues (*guṇakathaṃ*) of the Exalted One (*bhagavato*), they would rise up, interrupt me, and speak about the virtues (*guṇaṃ kathessanti*) of their own teachers (*satthārānaṃ*). Thus, my talk on the virtues (*guṇakathā*) of the Teacher (*satthu*) will not reach its conclusion (*pariyosānaṃ na gamissati*).\n\nBut as the king, having approached those supporters of families (*kulūpake*) and finding their account of virtues to be substanceless (*gahitāsāratāya*), will be dissatisfied (*anattamano hutvā*) with their account of virtues (*guṇakathāya*), he will question me (*paṭipucchissati*). Then, without being interrupted (*nibbikkhepaṃ*), I will explain the virtues (*guṇaṃ kathetvā*) of the Teacher (*satthu*) and, knowing such talk to be substanceless, take the king along with me to meet the Teacher (*satthu santikaṃ gahetvā gamissāmi*). Thus he remained silent in order to cut off interruptions (*vikkhepapacchedanatthaṃ tuṇhī ahosīti*).\n\nThose ministers also thought: “Today the king extols the night in five ways (*pañcahi padehi rattiṃ thometi*). Surely he wishes to approach some recluse (*samaṇaṃ*) or Brahmin (*brāhmaṇaṃ*), question him, and hear the Dhamma (*dhammaṃ sotukāmo*). He will show great honor (*mahantaṃ sakkāraṃ karissati*) to the one whose Dhamma inspires his confidence (*pasīdissati*). And it will be fortunate (*bhaddaṃ*) for the one whose recluse (*samaṇo*) wins the support of the royal family (*rājakulūpako hoti*).”",

    "commentary_english": "157. Then, the king of kings, having heard their words, thought: \"I do not wish to hear the words of those who are speaking.\n\nBut the one whose words I wish to hear, he is silent like a *supaṇṇa* bird who has drunk *nāga* poison. This is useless to me.\"\n\nThen it occurred to him: \"Jīvaka is a supporter of the Exalted Buddha (buddha bhagavato), the peaceful one. He himself is peaceful. Therefore, like a *bhikkhu* endowed with vows (*vattasampanno*), he sits silently. He will not speak unless I speak. The foot of the elephant must be grabbed while the elephant is trampling.” Thus he himself took the initiative in consulting him.\n\nTherefore it was said: \"Then, the king...\"\n\nThere, what is the silence? For what reason is he silent?\n\nWhile each of these ministers praises the recluse (*samaṇa*) he supports, you do not even open your mouth.\n\nDon’t you support some recluse as they do? Are you poor? Didn’t my father give you royalties? Or do you lack faith in anyone?” he asks.\n\nThen Jīvaka thought: \"The king wants me to speak about the virtues (*guṇa*) of the recluse I support. This is not the time for me to remain silent. I should not speak about the virtues of the Teacher (satthu) in the way these ministers speak about the virtues of their recluses—by first bowing to the king and then sitting down.” So he rose up from his seat, bowed down to the ground in the direction where the Exalted One (bhagavato) was dwelling, lifted his hands to his head in reverential salutation (*añjaliṃ*), and said: “Great king (*mahārāja*), do not think of me thus, ‘This one approaches any recluse.’ For the ten-thousand world-system trembled at my Teacher’s descent into his mother’s womb, at his emergence from his mother’s womb, at his Great Renunciation (*mahābhinikkhamane*), at his perfect awakening (*sambodhiyaṃ*), and at the turning of the Wheel of the Dharma (*dharmacakrapravartane*). Thus, he performed the Twin Miracle (*yamakapāṭihāriyaṃ*), thus, he descended from the *deva* world. I will speak of the virtues (*guṇa*) of the Teacher (satthuno). Listen with a focused mind, great king (*mahārāja*),\" and having said, \"This, O king (*deva*), is the Exalted One (bhagavā), the worthy one (*arahaṃ*), the perfectly awakened Buddha (*sammāsambuddho*)...\" and so on.\n\nThere, that indeed, the Exalted One (bhagavantaṃ), is a word of employment in the sense of describing suchness; the meaning is, indeed, of that Exalted One (bhagavato).\n\n\"Kalyāṇo\" means endowed with good qualities (*kalyāṇaguṇasamannāgato*), \"seṭṭho\" is said.\n\n*Kittisaddo* means fame itself.\n\nOr praise and proclamation.\n\n*Abbhuggato* means having risen, pervading the world together with the *deva*s.\n\nWhat is it like? \"Thus, that Exalted One (bhagavā) is the Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), the Perfectly Awakened One (*sammāsambuddho*)...\" and so on \"...the Exalted One (bhagavā).\"\n\nThere, this is the connection of words: \"That Exalted One (bhagavā) is thus the Worthy One (*arahaṃ*), is thus the Perfectly Awakened One (*sammāsambuddho*)...\" and so on \"...is thus the Exalted One (*bhagavā*).\"\n\nIt is said to be for this reason and for this reason.\n\nThere, because of being far from enemies, and because of destroying spokes, because of worthiness of requisites, etc., because of absence of secrecy in evil deeds, therefore, by these reasons, that Exalted One (bhagavā) is to be known as the Worthy One (*arahaṃ*) and so on. In this way, having established the matrix, all of these words have been expanded in the *Visuddhimagga*, in the section on recollection of the Buddha (*buddhānussatiniddese*). Therefore, their expansion should be taken from there.\n\nThen Jīvaka, having finished the meaning of each word, said: \"Thus, great king (*mahārāja*), the worthy one (*arahaṃ*) is my Teacher (satthā), thus the Perfectly Awakened One (*sammāsambuddho*)...thus the Exalted One (bhagavā),\" and having said: \"May you, O king (*deva*), visit that Exalted One (bhagavantaṃ), perhaps the mind of the king (*deva*) may be calmed by visiting that Exalted One (bhagavantaṃ).\"\n\nAnd here, saying \"May you, O king (*deva*), visit that Exalted One (bhagavantaṃ),\" he says: \"Great king (*mahārāja*), the Teacher (satthuno) has the power and ability to grasp the minds of all and to speak, even when questioned by hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of persons like yourself; approach him confidently, great king (*mahārāja*).\"\n\nWhen the king also heard this talk about the virtues (*guṇa*) of the Exalted One (bhagavato), his entire body was immediately suffused with the five grades of rapture (*pītiyā*).\n\nAt that very moment he became desirous to go to the Exalted One. Thinking, “If I am to go to the Buddha at this time there is no one apart from Jīvaka who can get the vehicles prepared quickly enough,” he said: “Then get the elephant vehicles prepared, friend Jīvaka.”",

Therefore, *tena hi* is a particle in the sense of concluding.\n\n\"Go, good Jīvaka,\" this is what was said.\n\n*Hatthiyānāni* means that among the many vehicles such as horse-drawn chariots, elephant vehicles (*hatthiyāna*) are the best; to the vicinity of the best person, one should go only in the best vehicle. Moreover, horse-drawn vehicles and chariots are noisy, and their sound is heard from afar, but even when an elephant vehicle (*hatthiyāna*) proceeds step by step, one does not hear a sound.\n\nThinking that one should approach the peaceful, quiescent Blessed One in peaceful, quiet vehicles, he said, \"Elephant vehicles.\"\n\n\"Five hundred elephant brigades\" means five hundred female elephants (*kareṇusatāni*).\n\n*Kappāpetvā* means having them made ready for mounting.\n\n*Ārohaṇīyanti* means suitable for mounting; the meaning is \"they are approachable.\"\n\nDid he do what was said by the king, or not said? It was not said.\n\nWhy? Through prudence.\n\nThus it occurred to him: \"The king says, 'I am going at this time,' and kings have many enemies.\"\n\nIf some obstacle should arise along the way, they will blame me, saying, \"How does Jīvaka take the king, taking the king out even at an improper time?\"\n\nThey will also blame the Blessed One, saying, \"The *śramaṇa* Gautama, thinking that ‘my talk is valid,’ gives a *dharma* talk without regard for the time.\"\n\nTherefore, I should act so that blame does not arise for me, nor for the Blessed One; and so that the king's protection is well arranged.\"\n\nThen, relying on women, there is no fear for men, thinking, \"I will go happily surrounded by women,\" having prepared five hundred elephant brigades, having five hundred women dressed as men, saying, \"Those with swords and spears in their hands should surround the king,\" then he thought again, \"This king does not have the supporting conditions for gaining the paths and fruits in this present existence. The Buddhas explain the *dharma* only after seeing the supporting conditions.\n\n\"Come now, let me assemble a great multitude of people. For when this is done, the Teacher, having seen someone with the supporting conditions, will teach the *dharma*, and that will be beneficial to the great multitude.\"\n\nSo he sent out announcements here and there, and had it proclaimed: \"Today the king is going to the vicinity of the Blessed One. Let everyone protect the king according to his means.\"\n\nThen the great multitude thought: \"The king is going to see the Teacher. What kind of *dharma* talk will there be? What is the use of our festive games? We will go there.\"\n\nTaking all kinds of garlands and perfumes, waiting for the king's arrival, they stood on the road.\n\nJīvaka also announced to the king: \"The elephant vehicles are prepared for you, Your Majesty. Now is the time, as you think fit.\"\n\nThere, \"Now is the time, as you think fit\" is a polite expression.\n\nThis is what was said: \"What was ordered by you, that was done by me.

The glory of sovereignty over two great kingdoms of three hundred yojanas.\n\"On such and such a day, the king will approach the *tathāgata*,\" even if the preparations were not complete beforehand, at that very moment five hundred women, having taken the guise of men, with their veils removed, swords fastened to their shoulders, and holding jeweled staffs and *tomaras*, went out.\nWhat was spoken with reference to that is: \"Having made each woman mount.\"\nMoreover, sixteen thousand dancing Kṣatriya women surrounded the king.\nAround them were hunchbacks, dwarfs, Kirātas, and so on.\nAround them were palace guards and trusted men.\nAround them were sixty thousand great ministers, adorned with various costumes and finery.\nAround them were ninety thousand royal sons, adorned with various ornaments and decorations, holding various kinds of weapons, like young *vidyādharas*.\nAround them, having put on hundred-fold garments and having made five hundred-fold garments into a single shawl, well-bathed, well-anointed, adorned with various ornaments such as golden garlands, ten thousand *brāhmaṇas*, raising their right hands, went along shouting cries of victory.\nAround them were five-piece orchestras.\nAround them was a line of bows.\nAround them were elephant troops.\nAround the elephants, they snorted, striking neck against neck.\nAround the horses were chariots colliding with each other.\nAround the chariots were warriors striking arm against arm.\nAround them were eighteen armies, shining with the wealth of ornaments corresponding to their own status.\nJust as an arrow, shot having stood at the limit, does not reach the king, so Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having arranged the king's retinue, went along not far from the king himself, thinking: \"If any danger arises, I will be the first to give the king the gift of life.\"\nBut there is no limit to the number of torches, whether hundreds or thousands, having referred to such kingly power, it was said: \"With the great power of the king, by which he went to the mango grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, he was successful.\"\nHere, \"he was suddenly gripped by fear\" refers to fear as mental anxiety, fear as knowledge, fear as a fearful object, and fear as moral dread, four kinds of fear. Among these, fear as mental anxiety is referred to in the passage: \"In dependence on birth there arises fear, fright,\" etc.\n“Those, having heard the Tathāgata’s teaching of the Dhamma, generally fall into fear, a sense of urgency, and terror” (Saṃ.\nNi.\n3.\n78) This is called knowledge of fear.\n“Is this the fear and dread that is coming?” (Ma.\nNi.\n1.\n49) Here, what is spoken of is the fear of fearful objects.\nThis is called moral dread.\nAmong these, here fear as mental anxiety, happened, it means it happened.\n*Chambhitatta* means the state of being startled.\n*Sakalasarīracalana* means the movement of the whole body.\n*Lomahaṃso* means *lomahaṃsanaṃ*, the hairs standing upwards, that is the meaning.\nBut that *lomahaṃso* also occurs through joy at the time of the arising of joy in hearing the Dharma and so on.\nAlso through fear in the visions of fearful kinds of ghosts and so on.\nHere, it should be understood, signifies fear and bristling of the hair.\n\nWhy then is he afraid? Some say it is because of the darkness.\n\nIn Rājagaha, it is said, there are thirty-two great gates and sixty-four small gates.\n\nJīvaka’s Mango Grove is between the rampart and the Gijjhakūṭa (Vulture Peak).\n\nHe, having left by the eastern gate, entered into the shadow of the mountain. There, the moon was covered by the peak of the mountain, and because of the shadow of the mountain and the shadow of the trees, it was dark, but that too was without reason.\n\nAt that time, indeed, there was no limit even to hundreds of thousands of torches.\n\nBecause of the quietness, however, he was afraid, suspecting Jīvaka.\n\nJīvaka, it is said, had already announced to him in the upper terrace of the palace: “Great king, the Blessed One (bhagavā) is fond of quietness. He should be approached quietly.”\n\nTherefore the king prohibited the sound of musical instruments (tūriyasaddaṃ).\n\nThe musical instruments (tūriyāni) were merely taken along. Also, they did not speak aloud, but went along giving signals with a snap of the fingers.\n\nIn the Mango Grove not even the sound of sneezing was heard.\n\nAnd kings generally delight in sound.\n\nBecause of that quietness, he became uneasy, and he aroused suspicion even regarding Jīvaka.\n\n“This Jīvaka told me there are twelve hundred and fifty monks (bhikkhus) in the Mango Grove,” he said.\n\nAnd here not even the slightest sound of sneezing is heard. I think it is unreal. Wishing to deceive me, he has led me out of the city, set up an army in front, and intends to arrest me and raise his own umbrella, desiring kingship for himself.\n\nFor he has the strength of five elephants (hatthīnaṃ balaṃ dhāreti).\n\nAnd he is going along not far from me, and there is not even a single armed man (āvudhahattho) near me.\n\n“O, what harm has befallen me!”\n\nHaving become so much afraid, he could not conduct himself fearlessly.\n\nHe revealed his own fearfulness to him.\n\nTherefore it has been said.\n\n\"Then the king…pe… no noise.\"\n\nThere, this is a friendly address, and it is as if it was said, \"Are you well, friend?\"\n\n\"You do not deceive,\" that is, saying that what is not, is, will you not deceive me?\n\n\"Noise\" means the noise of friendly conversation (kathāsallāpanigghoso).\n\nJīvaka [said]: \"Do not be afraid, great king (mahārāja)—this king does not know me; he does not know that I do not deprive another of life; but if I do not reassure him, he will perish,\" thinking thus, and making firm, reassuring him, and saying: \"Do not be afraid, great king,\" he spoke beginning with \"Not the gods...\"\n\n\"Go forward\" means go face to face, enter, is the meaning.\n\nHe says \"Go forward\" twice, hurrying along, because if he had said this once it would not be firm.\n\n“These lamps are burning in the pavilion hall, great king (mahārāja). A group of thieves does not stay where lamps are burning. And these lamps are burning in the pavilion hall.\"\n\nHe says: \"Go by this sign of the lamps, great king (mahārāja).\"",

Because of this, they say, he did not recognize him.\nThat is not the reason.

Not even one *bhikkhu* looked at the king or his assembly standing in front of the Blessed One, or at the retinue of nautch-girls adorned with all their ornaments (*sabbālaṅkāra-paṭimaṇḍitaṃ nāṭaka-parivāraṃ*).\n\nAll sat there, looking only at the Exalted One ( *bhagavantaṃ*).\n\nThe king, gaining confidence in such peace, again and again surveyed the company of *bhikkhus* sitting there with calm faculties, like a clear lake free from mud, and then uttered his joyful exclamation ( *udānaṃ udānesi*):\n\nThere, \"by this\" means that the monastic community is peaceful through bodily, verbal, mental, and ethical peace; \"by this peace\" is what is indicated.\n\nThere, he did not say this intending: “O, may my son go forth and become peaceful like these *bhikkhus*!”\n\nRather, having gained confidence seeing the company of *bhikkhus*, he remembered his son.\n\nFor that is the nature of people in the world: when they have gained something rare or seen something wonderful, they remember their dear relatives and friends (*ñātimittādīnaṃ*).\n\nThus, having gained confidence seeing the monastic community, he remembered his son, and spoke thus.\n\nMoreover, he said this because he was apprehensive about his son and desired peace for him.\n\nFor he thought: “My son will ask: ‘My father is young.\n\nWhere is my grandfather?’\"\n\nHearing ‘Your father killed him’, he might think: ‘Then I shall kill my father and rule the kingdom!’\n\nThus, apprehensive about his son, he spoke thus desiring this peace for him.\n\nYet though he said this,\n\nhis son eventually killed him.\n\nIn that dynasty parricide took place in five generations.\n\nAjātaśatru killed Bimbisāra; Udaya killed Ajātaśatru;\n\nUdayi was killed by his own son, Mahāmuṇḍika;\n\nMahāmuṇḍika was killed by his son Anuruddha;\n\nand Anuruddha was killed by his son Nāgadāsa.\n\nBut the citizens became angry and thinking, “These kings destroy their own lineage; what do we need them for?” they killed Nāgadāsa.\n\nWhy did he speak thus, “You have come well”? It is said that before the king uttered his exclamation, the Exalted One had thought: “The king, having come, stands here silent and speechless. What is he thinking?”\n\nHaving read his mind, he reflected: “Being unable to converse with me, he surveys the monastic community and remembers his son. Since he will be unable to say anything if I do not speak to him first, I will start a conversation with him.”\n\nTherefore, immediately after the king uttered his joyful exclamation, the Exalted One spoke the above words.\n\nThis is the meaning: “Great king, as rain water, falling upon the highlands, flows down to the plain, so as you survey the company of *bhikkhus*, your affection goes towards your son.”\n\nThereupon the king thought: “O, how wonderful are the virtues of the Buddha! There is no one who has committed such crimes towards the Exalted One as I have. I killed his chief supporter; I accepted the request of Devadatta and sent assassins to kill him; I released the elephant Nālāgiri against him; with my support Devadatta hurled a stone at him. The Buddha should not even open his mouth towards such a criminal as myself, yet he freely addresses me. O, the Exalted One is well-established in the five aspects of suchness (*pañcahākārehi tādilakkhaṇe suppatiṭṭhito*).\n\nI should not abandon such a teacher and search for a teacher elsewhere.” Filled with joy (*somanassajāto*), addressing the Exalted One (*bhagavantaṃ ālapanto*), he said: “Venerable sir (*bhante*), I love my son,” etc.",

    "commentary_english": "[Garuda Purana 167-169]\n\nIn the doctrine of Makkhali, the word *paccaya* is just a synonym for *hetu* (cause). With both words, he rejects the real condition for defilement, i.e. wrong bodily conduct, etc., and the real condition for purification, i.e. right bodily conduct, etc.\n\n*Attakāra* means personal determination.\n\nHe rejects also the *karma* (action) by reason of which beings attain the state of a god (*devattaṃ*), the state of Māra (*mārattaṃ*), the state of Brahmā (*brahmattampi*), the enlightenment of a disciple (*sāvakabodhiṃ*), the enlightenment of a *paccekabuddha* (*paccekabodhiṃ*), or omniscience (*sabbaññutaṃ*).\n\nBy the second expression, he rejects that other-determination (*parakāraṃ*) through reliance on the exhortation and instruction of another person (*parassa ovādānusāsaniṃ nissāya*), apart from a Great Being (*mahāsattaṃ*), the remaining people attain from good fortune in the human state (*manussasobhagyataṃ*) up to arahatship (*arahattaṃ pāpuṇāti*).\n\nThus, this fool strikes a blow at the Wheel of the Conqueror (*jinacakke pahāraṃ deti*).\n\n\"No personal determination\" (*natthi purisakāreti*): he rejects the personal determination (*purisakārena*) through which beings attain the aforementioned kinds of success (*vuttappakārā sampattiyo pāpuṇanti*).\n\n“No power” (*natthi balanti*): he denies that beings can establish themselves upon their own power (*attano bale patiṭṭhitā*), arouse their energy (*vīriyaṃ katvā*), and attain those kinds of success (*tā sampattiyo pāpuṇanti*).\n\n\"No energy,\" etc. are all just synonyms for personal determination (*purisakāravevacanāneva*).\n\nThey are brought in separately in order to reject the claim: \"This has occurred through our energy (*idaṃ no vīriyena*), this through personal strength (*purisathāmena*), and this through personal fortitude (*purisaparakkamena pavatta*).\"\n\n\"All sentient beings\" (*sabbe sattā*): he includes camels, oxen, donkeys, etc., without exception (*anavasese pariggaṇhāti*).\n\n\"All living beings\" (*sabbe pāṇā*): he says this with reference to creatures having one faculty (*ekindriyo pāṇo*) or two faculties (*dvindriyo pāṇo*), etc.\n\n\"All creatures\" (*sabbe bhūtā*): this refers to beings born from eggs (*aṇḍakosa*) or from the womb (*vatthikosesu bhūte sandhāya vadati*).\n\n\"All souls\" (*sabbe jīvā*): this refers to rice, barley, wheat, etc. (*sāli yava godhumādayo sandhāya vadati*).\n\nBecause they undergo growth (*virūhanabhāvena*), he regards them as having souls (*jīvasaññī*).\n\n\"Are helpless (*avasā*), powerless (*abalā*), devoid of energy (*avīriyā*)\": they have no self-control (*attano vaso*), power (*balaṃ*), or energy (*vīriyaṃ*).\n\n\"*Niyatisangatibhāvapariṇatā* (destiny, connection, nature and change)\": here, *niyati* means fixed.\n\n“Circumstance (*saṅgatīti*)\": going here and there among the six classes of men (*channaṃ abhijātīnaṃ tattha tattha gamanaṃ*).\n\n\"Nature (*bhāvo*)\": the inner nature itself (*sabhāvoyeva*).\n\nThus, through destiny (*niyatiyā*), circumstance (*saṅgatiyā*), and nature (*bhāvena*), they have attained various kinds of change (*nānappakārataṃ pattā*).\n\nWhatever will be will be (*yena hi yathā bhavitabbaṃ*), so that is how it is (*so tatheva bhavati*).\n\nWhatever will not be will not be (*yena na bhavitabbaṃ, so na bhavati*), this he shows (*dasseti*).\n\n\"The six classes of men\" (*chasvevābhijātīsūti*): abiding in the six classes of men (*chasu eva abhijātīsu ṭhatvā*), they experience pleasure and pain (*sukhañca dukkhañca paṭisaṃvedenti*).\n\nHe shows that there is no other plane of pleasure and pain (*aññā sukhadukkhabhūmi natthi*).\n\n“Hundreds of thousands of beginnings of wombs (*yonipamukhasatasahassāni*)”: fourteen hundred thousand of the main and best wombs (*pamukhayonīnaṃ uttamayonīnaṃ cuddasasatasahassāni*), plus six hundred others (*aññāni ca saṭṭhisatāni*) and six hundred others (*aññāni ca chasatāni*).\n\n\"Five hundred kinds of *kamma* (*pañca ca kammunosatāni*)\" means five hundred *kamma-sata* (*pañcakammasatāni*).\n\nHe explains a senseless view (*niratthakaṃ diṭṭhiṃ dīpeti*) devised solely by mere reasoning (*kevalaṃ takkamattakena*).\n\nThe same principle applies in the case of five kinds of *kamma* (*pañca ca kammāni*), three kinds of *kamma* (*tīṇi ca kammāni*), etc.\n\nBut some say: \"He speaks of five kinds of *kamma* (*pañca ca kammāni*) by way of the five sense faculties (*pañcindriyavasena bhaṇati*).\"\n\n\"Three\" means by way of bodily *kamma*, etc. (*kāyakammādivasenā*).\n\n“Full *kamma* and half *kamma* (*kamme ca upaḍḍhakamme ca*)”: here his theory is that bodily *kamma* (*kāyakammañca*) and verbal *kamma* (*vacīkammañca*) are full *kamma* (*kammanti laddhi*), and mental *kamma* (*manokammaṃ*) is half *kamma* (*upaḍḍhakammanti*).\n\n“Sixty-two pathways (*dvaṭṭhipaṭipadā*)” means he speaks of sixty-two pathways (*dvāsaṭṭhi paṭipadāti vadati*).\n\n\"Sixty-two sub-aeons (*dvaṭṭhantarakappā*)\": in a single great aeon (*ekasmiṃ kappe*) there are sixty-four sub-aeons (*catusaṭṭhi antarakappā nāma honti*).\n\nBut since he does not know about two of these (*aññe dve ajānanto*), he says thus (*evamāha*).\n\nHe declares that there are six classes of men (*chaḷābhijātiyo*): the black (*kaṇhābhijāti*), the blue (*nīlābhijāti*), the red (*lohitābhijāti*), the yellow (*haliddābhijāti*), the white (*sukkābhijāti*), and the ultimate white (*paramasukkābhijāti*).\n\nThe black class (*kaṇhābhijāti*) is made up of butchers (*orabbhikā*), hunters (*sākuṇikā*), trappers of wild beasts (*māgavikā*), butchers of pigs (*sūkarikā*), hunters (*luddā*), fishermen (*macchaghātakā*), thieves (*corā*), executioners (*coraghātakā*), prison wardens (*bandhanāgārikā*), and those in other cruel lines of work (*ye vā panaññepi keci kurūrakammantā*) (A.\n\nN.\n\n6.\n57). He says (*vadati*).\n\nThe blue class (*nīlābhijāti*) is made up of *bhikkhus* (*bhikkhū nīlābhijātīti vadati*). For *bhikkhus*, he says, eat having thrown thorns (*kaṇṭake pakkhipitvā khādanti*) into the four requisites (*catūsu paccayesu*).\n“The monks have thorny behavior” ( *bhikkhū kaṇṭakavuttikā*)— (a.\nni.\n6.\n57) This very thing is indeed the text.\nOr alternatively, he says that some who have gone forth are named as having thorny behavior ( *kaṇṭakavuttikā eva nāma eke pabbajitāti vadati*).\nThe red class is made up of the one-robed he Nigaṇṭhas ; ( *lohitābhijāti nāma nigaṇṭhā ekasāṭakāti vadati*).\nfor these are purer than the former two. ( *ime kira purimehi dvīhi paṇḍaratarā*).\nHe says, \"Lay followers in white robes are of the yellow class,\" ( *gihī odātavasanā acelakasāvakā haliddābhijātīti vadati*)\nThus he makes his own lay supporters superior even to the Nigaṇṭhas. ( *evaṃ attano paccayadāyake nigaṇṭhehipi jeṭṭhakatare karoti*).\nHe says, \"The Ājīvakas and Ājīvakinīs are of the white class.\" ( *ājīvakā ājīvakiniyo sukkābhijātīti vadati*).\nfor these, he says, are purer than the previous four. ( *te kira purimehi catūhi paṇḍaratarā*).\nThe ultimate white class is made up of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkiccha, and Makkhali Gosāla ( *nando, vaccho, kiso, saṅkiccho, makkhaligosālo, paramasukkābhijātīti*) (a.\nni.\n6.\n57) He says. ( *vadati*)\nfor they are the purest of all. ( *te kira sabbehi paṇḍaratarā*).\nHe declares that there are eight stages in the life of man: the stage of feebleness (*mandabhūmi*); the stage of play (*khiḍḍābhūmi*); the stage of learning to walk (*padavīmaṃsabhūmi*); the erect stage (*ujugatabhūmi*); the stage of training (*sekkhabhūmi*); the recluse stage (*samaṇabhūmi*); the conqueror stage (*jinabhūmi*); and the prostrate stage (*pannabhūmi*). ( *aṭṭha purisabhūmiyoti mandabhūmi, khiḍḍābhūmi, padavīmaṃsabhūmi, ujugatabhūmi, sekkhabhūmi, samaṇabhūmi , jinabhūmi, pannabhūmīti imā aṭṭha purisabhūmiyoti vadati*).\nThe stage of feebleness: this lasts for seven days following the day of birth; for after coming out from the womb beings are feeble and dull. He calls this the stage of feebleness ( *ayaṃ mandabhūmīti vadati*).\nThe stage of play: those who have come from an evil destination often cry and howl; those who come from a good destination remember it and laugh. This is called the stage of play. ( *ayaṃ khiḍḍābhūmi nāma*).\nThe stage of learning to walk: this is the stage when the child takes hold of its parents’ hands or feet, or a bed or chair, and places its feet on the ground. This is called the stage of learning to walk. ( *padavīmaṃsabhūmi nāma*).\nThe erect stage: this is the stage when it is able to walk on its feet. ( *ujugatabhūmi nāma*).\nThe stage of training: this is the stage when one has been trained in a craft.

He rejects this determination by others (*parakāra*).\n\nThus this fool strikes a blow at the Wheel of the Conqueror (*jinacakka*).\n\n\"No personal determination\" (*purisakāra*): he rejects the personal determination through which beings attain the aforementioned kinds of success (*sampatti*).\n\n\"No power\" (*bala*): he denies that beings can establish themselves upon their own power (*bala*), arouse their energy (*viriya*), and attain success (*sampatti*).\n\n\"No energy (*viriya*)\": all these terms are merely synonyms for personal determination (*purisakāra*).\n\nThey are brought in separately in order to reject the claim: “This has occurred through our energy (*vīriya*), personal strength (*purisathāma*), and personal fortitude (*purisaparakkama*).\"\n\n\"All sentient beings\" (*sabbe satta*): he includes camels (*oṭṭha*), oxen (*goṇa*), donkeys (*gadrabha*), etc., without exception.\n\n“All living beings” (*sabbe pāṇa*): he says this with reference to creatures having one faculty (*ekindriya pāṇa*), or two faculties (*dvindriya pāṇa*), etc.\n\n\"All creatures\" (*sabbe bhūta*): this refers to beings born from eggs (*aṇḍakosa*) or from the womb (*vatthikosa*).\n\n“All souls” (*sabbe jīva*): this refers to rice (*sāli*), barley (*yava*), wheat (*godhuma*), etc.\n\nbecause they undergo growth (*virūhana*), he regards them as having souls (*jīvasaññī*).\n\n\"Are helpless (*avasā*), powerless (*abalā*), devoid of energy (*avīriya*)\": they have no self-control (*vaso*), power (*bala*), or energy (*vīriya*).\n\n*Niyatisangatibhāvapariṇatā*: here, *niyati* means fixed (*niyatā*).\n\n\"Circumstance\" (*saṅgati*): going here and there among the six classes of men (*abhijāti*).\n\n\"Nature\" (*bhāva*): the inner nature (*sabhāva*).\n\nThus, conditioned by destiny (*niyati*), circumstance (*saṅgati*), and nature (*bhāva*), they attain diversity (*nānappakārata*).\n\nWhatever will be will be (*yathā bhavitabbaṃ*), that is how it is (*tatheva bhavati*).\n\nWhatever will not be will not be (*na bhavitabbaṃ*),\" he shows.\n\n“The six classes of men” (*chasvevābhijāti*): abiding in the six classes of men (*abhijāti*), they experience pleasure (*sukha*) and pain (*dukkha*).\n\nHe shows that there is no other plane of pleasure and pain (*sukhadukkhabhūmi*).\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of wombs\" (*yonipamukhasatasahassāni*): fourteen hundred thousand of the principal wombs (*pamukhayoni*) of the highest wombs (*uttamayoni*), and also sixty hundred, and also six hundred.\n\n\"Five hundred kinds of *kamma* (*pañca kammunosatāni*)\": and also five hundred *kamma* (*pañcakammasatāni*).\n\nHe explains a senseless view devised solely by mere reasoning (*takka*).\n\nThe same principle applies in the case of five kinds of *kamma* (*pañca kammāni*), three kinds of *kamma* (*tīṇi kammāni*), etc.\n\nBut some say: \"He speaks of five kinds of *kamma* (*pañca kammāni*) by way of the five sense faculties (*pañcindriya*).\n\nand three kinds by way of bodily action (*kāyakamma*) etc.\"\n\n\"Full *kamma* (*kamma*) and half-*kamma* (*upaḍḍhakamme*)\": here his theory is that bodily action (*kāyakamma*) and verbal action (*vacīkamma*) are full *kamma* (*kamma*) and mental action (*manokamma*) is half-*kamma* (*upaḍḍhakamme*).\n\n\"Sixty-two pathways\" (*dvaṭṭhipaṭipadā*): he speaks of sixty-two pathways (*dvāsaṭṭhi paṭipadā*).\n\n\"Sixty-two sub-aeons (*dvaṭṭhantarakappa*)\": in a single great aeon (*kappa*) there are sixty-four sub-aeons (*antarakappa*).\n\nbut since he does not know about two of these, he says .\n\nHe declares that there are six classes of men (*abhijāti*): the black (*kaṇhābhijāti*), the blue (*nīlābhijāti*), the red (*lohitābhijāti*), the yellow (*haliddābhijāti*), the white (*sukkābhijāti*), and the ultimate white (*paramasukkābhijāti*).\n\nThe black class (*kaṇhābhijāti*) is made up of butchers (*orabbhika*), hunters (*sākuṇika*), trappers of wild beasts (*māgavika*), pork butchers (*sūkarika*), hunters (*ludda*), fishermen (*macchaghātaka*), thieves (*cora*), executioners (*coraghātaka*), prison wardens (*bandhanāgārika*), and those in other cruel lines of work (*kurūrakammanta*).\n\n(A.\n\nNi.\n\n6.\n\n57) He says.\n\nThe blue class (*nīlābhijāti*) is made up of monks (*bhikkhū*). For monks (*bhikkhū*), he says, eat having thrown thorns (*kaṇṭake*) into the four requisites (*paccaya*).\n“Monks have thorny behavior,\" (a.\nni.\n6.\n57) this is exactly its *pāli*.\nOr alternatively, he says that some who have gone forth have thorny behavior.\nThe red class is made up of the one-robed he Nigaóþhas; he says.\nfor these are purer than the former two.\nHouseholders wearing white clothes are disciples of the ascetics and belong to the turmeric class; he says.\nThus he makes his own lay supporters superior even to the Nigaóþhas.\nThe Ājīvakas and female Ājīvikas belong to the ultimate white class, he declares.\nfor these, he says, are purer than the previous four.\nThe ultimate white class is made up of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saòkiccha, and Makkhali Gosála; (a.\nni.\n6.\n57) He says.\nfor they are the purest of all.\nHe declares that there are eight stages in the life of man: the stage of feebleness; the stage of play; the stage of learning to walk; the erect stage; the stage of training; the recluse stage; the conqueror stage; and the prostrate stage.\nThe stage of feebleness : this lasts for seven days following the day of birth; for after coming out from the womb beings are feeble and dull. He says, this is the stage of feebleness.\nThe stage of play : those who have come from an evil destination often cry and howl; those who come from a good destination remember it and laugh. This is called the stage of play.\nThe stage of learning to walk : this is the stage when the child takes hold of its parents’ hands or feet, or a bed or chair, and places its feet on the ground. This is called the stage of learning to walk.\nThe erect stage : this is the stage when it is able to walk on its feet.\nThe stage of training : this is the stage when one has been trained in a craft.\nThe recluse stage : this is the time when one has renounced the household life and gone forth .\nThe conqueror stage : this is the time when, having served a teacher, one knows.\nThe monk, learned, victorious, does not say anything: thus he calls the monk who obtains nothing, the prostrate stage.\nForty-nine Ājīvaka hundreds means forty-nine hundred ways of Ājīvaka life.\nWandering mendicant hundreds means hundreds of wandering mendicant ordinations.\nNāga abodes hundreds means hundreds of Nāga *maṇḍalas*.\nSense faculty twenties means twenty hundred sense faculties.\nHell thirties means thirty hundred hells.\n“Thirty-six realms of dust”: places where dust accumulates; he says this referring to the backs of the hands, bottom of the feet, etc.\n“Seven spheres of percipient beings”: he says this referring to camels, oxen, donkeys, goats, cattle, deer, and buffaloes.\n“Seven spheres of non-percipient beings”: he says this referring to rice, paddy, barley, wheat, millet, beans, and *kadrūsaka*.\n“Seven kinds of jointed plants”: plants grown from joints; he refers to sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, etc.\n“Seven kinds of gods”: there are many kinds of gods,\nbut he says there are seven.\nHuman beings, too, are of infinite kinds, but he says there are seven.\n“Seven kinds of demons” : there are numerous kinds of demons, but he says there are seven.\n“Seven great lakes”: he says this mentioning the Kaṇṇamuṇḍa, Rathakāra, Anotatta, Sìhappapáta, Chaddanta, Mandákinì, and Kuṇáladaha.\nThe toggle is allowable.\nIt falls, thus it is a great fall (papātāti mahāpapātā).\nThere are hundreds of falls, thus there are minor hundreds of falls (papātasatānīti khuddakapapātasatāni).\nHe sleeps, thus it is a great sleep (supināti mahāsupinā).\nThere are hundreds of dreams, thus there are minor hundreds of dreams (supinasatānīti khuddakasupinasatāni).\nHe is of a great aeon, thus he is among the great aeons (mahākappinoti mahākappānaṃ).\nThere, he describes the duration of a great aeon as the time it would take to drain a single great lake (mahāsarā) seven times by removing a single drop of water (udakabinduṃ) with the tip of a blade of *kuśa*-grass (*kusaggena*) once every hundred years (tattha ekamhā mahāsarā vassasate vassasate kusaggena ekaṃ udakabinduṃ nīharitvā sattakkhattuṃ tamhi sare nirudake kate eko mahākappoti vadati).\nHis theory asserts that when eighty-four hundred thousand of such great aeons have passed, the foolish (*bāle*) and the wise (*paṇḍite*) make an end to suffering (evarūpānaṃ mahākappānaṃ caturāsītisatasahassāni khepetvā bāle ca paṇḍite ca dukkhassantaṃ karontīti ayamassa laddhi).\nThe wise man, he says, cannot purify himself beforehand (paṇḍitopi kira antarā visujjhituṃ na sakkoti).\nand the fool does not continue on beyond (bālopi tato uddhaṃ na gacchati).\nBy this moral discipline (śīlena), whether by the moral discipline of the naked ascetics (*acelakasīlena*) or by any other (sīlenāti acelakasīlena vā aññena vā yena kenaci).\n“Observance” should be understood similarly (vatenāti tādiseneva vatena).\nThrough austerity, it is through the action of austerity (tapenāti tapokammena).\nThat the one who considers himself a wise man should “ripen unripened karma” i.e. that he should purify himself beforehand (aparipakkaṃ paripāceti nāma, yo ‘‘ahaṃ paṇḍito’’ti antarā visujjhati).\nor “eliminate ripened karma whenever it comes up,” or that the one who considers himself a fool should continue on beyond the time stated to be the limits (paripakkaṃ phussa phussa byantiṃ karoti nāma yo ‘‘ahaṃ bālo’’ti vuttaparimāṇaṃ kālaṃ atikkamitvā yāti).\n“that cannot be,” that cannot be (hevaṃ natthīti evaṃ natthi).\ni.e. neither is able to do that (tañhi ubhayampi na sakkā kātunti dīpeti).\nMeasured by a *droṇa*, it is as if measured by a *droṇa* (doṇamiteti doṇena mitaṃ viya).\nPleasure and pain, it is pleasure and pain (sukhadukkheti sukhadukkhaṃ).\nThe limit having been made, it is with a limit made at a time that has been stated (pariyantakateti vuttaparimāṇena kālena katapariyante).\nThere is no decrease or increase, there are no decrease or increase (natthihāyanavaḍḍhaneti natthi hāyanavaḍḍhanāni).\n“Saṃsāra’s limits … . can neither be shortened nor extended”: saṃsāra is not shortened for the wise man, nor extended for the fool (na saṃsāro paṇḍitassa hāyati, na bālassa vaḍḍhatīti attho).\nElevation and degradation, it is elevation and degradation (ukkaṃsāvakaṃseti ukkaṃsāvakaṃsā).\nThis is a term for decrease and increase (hāyanavaḍḍhanānametaṃ adhivacanaṃ).\nNow, illustrating that meaning by way of a simile, he said, “Just as, for example…” and so on (idāni tamatthaṃ upamāya sādhento ‘‘seyyathāpi nāmā’’tiādimāha).\nThere, a ball of thread, it is a ball of thread that has been wound (tattha suttaguḷeti veṭhetvā katasuttaguḷe).\nBecause it flees as it is being unwound, having stood on a mountain (pabbate) or at the top of a tree (rukkagge), it goes as it is being unwound according to the measure of the thread (sutta), when the thread (sutte) is exhausted, it remains right there, it does not go (nibbeṭhiyamānameva paletīti pabbate vā rukkhagge vā ṭhatvā khittaṃ suttappamāṇena nibbeṭhiyamānameva gacchati, sutte khīṇe tattheva tiṭṭhati, na gacchati).\nJust so, he shows that one does not go beyond the time that has been stated (evameva vuttakālato uddhaṃ na gacchatīti dasseti).",

These are the eight stages in the life of man, he says.\nThe stage of feebleness (mandabhūmi): this lasts for seven days following the day of birth; for after coming out from the confined place (sambādhaṭṭhānato), beings are feeble (mandā) and dull (momūhā), this is called the stage of feebleness, he says.\nThe stage of play (khiḍḍābhūmi): those who have come from an evil destination (duggatito āgatā) often cry and howl; those who come from a good destination (sugatito āgatā) remember it and laugh, this is called the stage of play.\nThe stage of learning to walk (padavīmaṃsabhūmi): this is the stage when the child takes hold of its parents’ hands or feet, or a bed or chair, and places its feet on the ground, this is called the stage of learning to walk.\nThe erect stage (ujugatabhūmi): this is the stage when it is able to walk on its feet.\nThe stage of training (sekkhabhūmi): this is the stage when one has been trained in a craft.\nThe recluse stage (samaṇabhūmi): this is the time when one has renounced the household life and gone forth.\nThe conqueror stage (jinabhūmi): this is the time when, having served a teacher (ācariyaṃ sevitvā), one knows.\nA monk, a wise man, a conqueror does not say anything; thus he calls the *samaṇa* who has not obtained anything the prostrate stage (pannabhūmi), he says.\nForty-nine Ājīvaka hundreds (ekūnapaññāsa ājīvakasateti): forty-nine hundreds of Ājīvaka ways of life (ekūnapaññāsaājīvakavuttisatāni).\nWandering mendicant hundreds (paribbājakasateti): hundreds of wandering mendicant renunciations (paribbājakapabbajjāsatāni).\nNāga dwelling hundreds (nāgāvāsasateti): hundreds of Nāga circles (nāgamaṇḍalasatāni).\nTwenty sense faculty hundreds (vīse indriyasateti): twenty hundreds of sense faculties (vīsatindriyasatāni).\nThirty hell hundreds (tiṃse nirayasateti): thirty hundreds of hells (tiṃsa nirayasatāni).\nThirty-six realms of dust (rajodhātuyo): places where dust accumulates (rajaokiraṇaṭṭhānāni);

He shows: all are annihilated just where they are.\n\nNo mother, no father: He says this intending that there are no fruits of right conduct (*sammāpaṭipatti*) and wrong conduct (*micchāpaṭipatti*) towards them.\n\nNo beings who have taken rebirth: He says there are no beings who, having passed away (*cavitvā*), reappear (*upapajjanakā*).\n\n*Cātumahābhūtika* means consisting of the four great elements ( *catumahābhūta*).\n\nThe earth ( *pathavī*) returns to and merges with the body of earth ( *pathavikāya*); the internal earth element (*ajjhattikapathavīdhātu*) [merges with] the external earth element (*bāhirapathavīdhātuṃ*).\n\n*Anupeti* means it goes along with.\n\n*Anupagacchati* is a synonym of that.\n\n*Anugacchati* also has the same meaning.\n\nHe approaches it with both; he shows that he approaches it.\n\nThe same method applies in the case of the other elements (*āpādīsupi*).\n\nThe sense faculties (*indriyāni*)—the mind (*manas*) being the sixth— pass over into space (*ākāsaṃ pakkhandanti*).\n\n*Āsandipañcamā* means, with the fifth being the reclining couch, the couch and four men standing holding the feet of the couch, that is the meaning.\n\n*Yāvāḷāhana* means as far as the cemetery (*susānā*).\n\n*Padāni* means qualities and non-qualities such as, ‘This one was moral, that one was immoral,’ etc., or it is intended that the body is what is meant by *padāni*.\n\n*Kāpotakāni* means having the color of pigeons ( *kapota-vaṇṇāni*), the color of dove’s wings ( *pārāvatapakkha-vaṇṇāni*), that is the meaning.\n\n*Bhassantā* means *bhasmantā*, or this itself is the Pāḷi text.\n\n*Āhuti* means gifts given with presents, gifts of honor, etc., all of that has ashes as its end, it does not go beyond that yielding fruit, that is the meaning.\n\n*Dattupaññattaṃ* means prescribed by foolish men (*bālamanussehi*).\n\nThis is said: 'Giving ( *dānaṃ*) is prescribed by fools who are without wisdom (*abuddhīhi*), not by the wise ( *paṇḍitehi*)'.\n\nFools give ( *denti*), the wise take ( *gaṇhanti*)', he shows.\n\nAmong these, Pūraṇa, with his statement “By doing so there is no evil,” denies action (*kamma*).\n\nAjita, with his statement “One is annihilated with the breakup of the body ( *kāyassa bhedā ucchijjatī*),” denies the result (*vipāka*).\n\nMakkhali, with his statement “There is no cause ( *natthi hetū*),” denies both.\n\nBy denying action (*kamma*), one denies its result (*vipāka*), by denying the result (*vipāka*) one denies action (*kamma*).\n\nThus all these thinkers, by denying both, in effect espouse acausalism (*ahetukavādā*), the inefficacy of action (*akiriyavādā*), and moral nihilism (*natthikavādā*).\n\nWhen people accept these theories and then recite and investigate them while sitting in their night-quarters (*rattiṭṭhāne*) or day-quarters (*divāṭhāne*), wrong mindfulness becomes established, taking as object: “No evil is done ( *karoto na karīyati pāpaṃ*),” or “There is no cause (*hetu* ) or condition ( *paccayo*),” or “The dead are annihilated (*mato ucchijjatī*).” The mind becomes one-pointed. The impulsions run their course. At the first impulsion these people are curable; and so too at the second, etc. But at the seventh they cannot be cured even by the Buddhas; they cannot be turned.\n\nSomeone might espouse one view among these, another two, another three. But whether one espouses one, two, or three views, one adopts a wrong view with fixed consequences. One has met an obstruction to the path to heaven (*saggamaggāvaraṇa*) and an obstruction to the path to liberation (*mokkhamaggāvaraṇa*). It is impossible for him to reach heaven (*sagga*) immediately following this present existence, much less to reach liberation (*mokkha*).\n\nThis being is called a stump in the round of existence (*vaṭṭakhāṇu*), a watchman of the earth (*pathavigopako*). Generally, one like this does not emerge from existence (*bhava*).",

    "commentary_english": "190. Then the Blessed One said this, he said this, now it should be said, \"Here, great king,\" and so on, the meaning is that he spoke the entire discourse.\n\nThere, *idha* means a particle indicating place and location, and it is used with reference to the world in some instances.\n\nAs he said, \"Here, the *tathāgata* arises in the world.\"\n\nIn some instances, regarding the teaching, as he said, \"Here, monks, is the first ascetic, here is the second ascetic\" (A.\nNi.\n4.\n241).\n\nIn some instances, regarding opportunity.\n\nAs he said, \"In some instances, it is merely to fill the line.\"\n\nAs he said, \"Here, monks, I have eaten and am satisfied\" (M.\nNi.\n1.\n30).\n\nHere, however, it should be understood as being said with reference to the world.\n\n*Mahārāja*, to teach the teaching as promised, he addresses him again as *mahārāja*.\n\nThis is what was said: \"Great king, in this world the *tathāgata* arises, the *arhat*…pe… the Buddha, the Blessed One.\"\n\nThere, the word *tathāgata* is mentioned in the *Brahmajāla*.\n\n*Arhat* and so on are explained in detail in the *Visuddhimagga*.\n\nHere, regarding \"arises in the world,\" the world (*loka*) is threefold: the world of space (*okāsaloka*), the world of beings (*sattaloka*), and the world of formations (*saṅkhāraloka*).\n\nHere, however, the world of beings (*sattaloka*) is intended.\n\nAnd though the *tathāgata* arises in the world of beings, he does not arise in the world of gods (*devaloka*), nor in the *brahmaloka*, but only in the world of humans (*manussaloka*).\n\nEven in the world of humans (*manussaloka*), not in another *cakravāḷa*, but only in this *cakravāḷa*.\n\nEven there, not in all places, \"In the eastern direction is a town called Gajaṅgala, beyond that is Mahāsāla, beyond that are the outlying districts, inside that is the middle region. In the southeast direction is a river called Salalavatī.\n\nBeyond that are the outlying districts, inside that is the middle region. In the southern direction is a town called Setakaṇṇika, beyond that are the outlying districts, inside that is the middle region. In the western direction is a *brāhmaṇa* village called Thūṇa, beyond that are the outlying districts, inside that is the middle region. In the northern direction is a mountain called Usiraddhaja, beyond that are the outlying districts, inside that is the middle region.\" Thus, within these defined boundaries, the *tathāgata* arises in the middle region, which is 300 *yojanas* in length, 250 *yojanas* in width, and 900 *yojanas* in circumference.\n\nNot only the *tathāgata*, but also the *paccekabuddhas*, chief disciples (*aggasāvakā*), eighty great elders (*asītimahātherā*), the Buddha's mother (*buddhamātā*), the Buddha's father (*buddhapitā*), the wheel-turning monarch (*cakkavattī rājā*), and other worthy *brāhmaṇa* householders (*gahapatikā*) also arise here.\n\nThere, the *tathāgata*, from the time of receiving the meal of honey-rice (*madhupāyāsa*) offered by Sujātā up to the path of *arhatship* (*arahattamagga*), is said to \"arise,\" and with the attainment of the fruit of *arhatship* (*arahattaphala*), he is said to have \"arisen.\"\n\nOr alternatively, from the time of his great renunciation (*mahābhinikkhamana*) up to the path of *arhatship* (*arahattamagga*).\n\nOr from the time in the Tusita heaven (*tusitabhavana*) up to the path of *arhatship* (*arahattamagga*).\n\nOr from the base of Dīpaṅkara's feet up to the path of *arhatship* (*arahattamagga*), is said to \"arise,\" and with the attainment of the fruit of *arhatship* (*arahattaphala*), he is said to have \"arisen.\"\n\nHere, \"arises\" is said with reference to the state of having arisen first of all (*sabbapaṭhamaṃ uppannabhāvaṃ sandhāya*).\n\nThe meaning here is, \"The *tathāgata* has arisen in the world (*loke uppanno hoti*).\"\n\n\"He, this world\" means he, the Blessed One (*bhagavā*), this world.\n\nNow, he indicates what should be said.\n\n\"*Sadevaka*\" means with the gods (*devehi*), *sadevaka*.\n\nLikewise, with Māra (*mārena*), *samāraka*; with Brahmā (*brahmunā*), *sabrahmaka*; with ascetics and *brāhmaṇas* (*samaṇabrāhmaṇehi*), *sassamaṇabrāhmaṇim*.\n\n*Pajātattā pajā*, that *pajaṃ*.\n\nWith gods and humans (*devamanussehi*), *sadevamanussaṃ*.\n\nThere, by the term \"*sadevakavacanena*,\" the five abodes of the gods in the desire realm (*kāmāvacaradeva*) should be understood.\n\nBy the term \"*samāraka vacanena*,\" the sixth abode of the gods in the desire realm (*chaṭṭhakāmāvacaradevaggahaṇaṃ*) is [meant].\nBy the phrase \"its Brahmās\" (*sabrahmaka*), the Brahmās such as those of Brahmā's retinue, etc., are included.\nThe phrase “with its recluses and brahmins,” (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇīvacanena*) includes both those recluses and *brāhmaṇas* who are hostile and opposed to the Buddha’s dispensation, and those who have truly stilled and expelled evil.\nBy the expression *pajā*, there is the taking of the world of living creatures.\nBy the expression *sadevamanussa*, there has been taken the conventional gods (*sammuti deva*) and the remaining human beings.\nThus, by the first three phrases here, the world of beings along with the physical world is included.\nBy the word \"generation\" (*pajā*) with its two qualifying phrases, the world of beings only is included; thus, it should be understood.\nAnother method: By mentioning \"with its gods\" (*sadevaka*), the gods of the immaterial world (*arūpāvacara*) are included.\nBy mentioning \"its Māras\" (*samāraka*), the gods of the six sense-sphere heavenly worlds (*cha kāmāvacara*) are included.\nBy mentioning \"its Brahmās\" (*sabrahmaka*), the fine-material Brahma-world (*rūpī brahmaloko*) is included.\nBy mentioning “with its recluses and *brāhmaṇas*,” etc., the human world with its conventional gods and its four social orders, or all the rest of the world of beings, is included.\nAnd also, by the expression \"with its gods\" (*sadevaka*), He indicates the state of realization of the entire world, through delimitation by way of the most excellent.\nThen some might think: “Māra is very powerful—he is the ruler and master of the six sense-sphere heavens. What, has he realized him, too?” Dispelling their doubts, he says: “its Māras (*samāraka*).\"\nStill others might think: \"Brahmā is very powerful. With one finger he illuminates a thousand world-systems; with two …pe… with ten fingers he illuminates ten thousand world-systems.\nAnd he experiences the unsurpassed bliss of the *jhānasamāpatti* attainments. What, has he realized him, too?” Dispelling their doubts, he says: “its Brahmās (*sabrahmaka*).\"\nThen some think: “There are many recluses and *brāhmaṇas* opposed to the dispensation. What, has he realized them, too?” Dispelling their doubts, he says: “With its recluses and *brāhmaṇas* (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajanti*).\"\nThus, having revealed his realization of the most excellent states, with the phrases \"with its rulers and its people\" (*sadevamanussa*) he reveals his realization of the rest of the world of beings, delimiting it by way of its most excellent members with the reference to conventional gods and the rest of humanity.\nThis is the sequence of states here.\nBut the Ancients say that the phrase \"with its gods\" (*sadevaka*) indicates the rest of the world together with the gods.\n\"Its Māras\" (*samāraka*) means the rest of the world together with Māra.\nAnd \"its Brahmās\" (*sabrahmaka*) means the rest of the world together with Brahmā.\nThus, with these three phrases, he includes all beings found in the three planes of existence, presenting them under three different aspects, and with the next two phrases—\"this generation with its recluses and *brāhmaṇas*, its rulers and people\" (*sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiṃ pajaṃ sadevamanussa*)—he again exhaustively treats the world.\nThus, with these five phrases, the three realms of existence are exhaustively presented under different aspects.\n\"Having directly experienced it himself through higher knowledge, he declares it.\" Here, \"himself\" means having become one who is independent.\n\"Higher knowledge\" (*abhiññā*) means knowing through higher, additional knowledge (*adhikena ñāṇena ñatvāti attho*).\n\"Having realized\" (*sacchikatvā*) means having made it directly known; by this, inferential knowledge is rejected.\n\"Declares\" (*pavedeti*) means awakens, informs, reveals.\nHe teaches the *dharma* that is good in the beginning…pe… good in the end (*so dhammaṃ deseti ādikalyāṇaṃ…pe… pariyosānakalyāṇanti*); that Blessed One, out of compassion for beings, even abandons the unsurpassed bliss of solitude and teaches the *dharma*.\nAnd whether he teaches little or much, the *dharma* he teaches has the quality of being good in the beginning, etc. (*ādikalyāṇādippakārameva deseti*).\nHe teaches, making it good, lovely, faultless, in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end; this is what is meant (*ādimhipi, kalyāṇaṃ bhaddakaṃ anavajjameva katvā deseti, majjhepi, pariyosānepi, kalyāṇaṃ bhaddakaṃ anavajjameva katvā desetīti vuttaṃ hoti*).\nThere, a teaching has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and the dispensation (*sāsana*) as a whole has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\nWith regard to a teaching, even in a verse of four lines, the first line is the beginning, the two lines following it the middle, and the last line the end.\nIn a *sūtra* with a single sequence of meaning, the introduction (*nidāna*) is the beginning, the phrase \"Thus spoke the Exalted One\" (*idamavocāti*) is the end, and what comes in between these is the middle.\nIn a *sūtra* with several sequences of meaning, the first sequence (*paṭhamānusandhi*) is the beginning, the final sequence (*anusandhi*) is the end, and what comes in between—whether one, two, or many—is the middle.\nWith regard to the dispensation (*sāsana*), moral discipline (*sīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), and insight (*vipassanā*) are the beginning.\nAnd it was said, \"What is the beginning of wholesome qualities? Moral conduct that is very pure and a view that is upright (*sīlañca suvisuddhaṃ diṭṭhi ca ujukā*)\" (Saṃ.\nNi.\n5.\n369).\n\"There is, monks (*bhikkhave*), a middle way awakened to by the *Tathāgata* (*tathāgatena*)\"—thus it is said; the Noble Path (*ariyamaggo*) is the middle.\nThe fruit (*phala*) and *Nirvāṇa* (*nibbāna*) are the end.\n“This is the goal of the holy life, this is its essence, this is its end”—(M.I,324) for here, the fruit is called the end.\n\n“Friend Visākha, the holy life plunges into Nibbāna, Nibbāna is its final resort, Nibbāna is its end”—(M.I,466) and here, Nibbāna is called the end.\n\nHere, the beginning, middle, and end intended are those of the teaching (desanā).\n\nFor when the Exalted One teaches the Dhamma, he teaches it showing moral discipline (sīla) in the beginning, the path (magga) in the middle, and Nibbāna in the end.\n\nThus it is said: “He teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning (ādikalyāṇaṃ), good in the middle (majjhekalyāṇaṃ), and good in the end (pariyosānakalyāṇaṃ).”\n\nTherefore, another Dhamma speaker, when speaking the Dhamma, [should do so] possessing meaning (sātthaṃ) and phrasing (sabyañjanaṃ). For if the teaching is based on descriptions of gruel, cooked rice, women, men, and so on, he does not teach with meaning.\n\nBut the Exalted One, having abandoned such kinds of teaching (desanā), presents a teaching concerned with the four foundations of mindfulness (catusatipaṭṭhānādinissitaṃ), etc.\n\nTherefore he is said to teach the Dhamma “possessing meaning” (sātthaṃ).\n\nOne whose teaching lacks the complete variety of phrases, or who confuses the various kinds of sounds—like the language of the Tamil, Kirata, Savara, and other barbarians—is said to have a teaching that is “without phrasing” (abyanjanā), due to the absence of complete phrasing.\n\nBut the Exalted One, without slurring together the ten kinds of sounds mentioned, teaches the Dhamma making it complete in phrasing (paripuṇṇabyañjanaṃ), therefore he is said to teach the Dhamma \"possessing phrasing\" (sabyañjanaṃ).\n\nHere, in \"entirely complete\" (kevalaparipuṇṇanti), \"entirely\" (kevalaṃ) means all-inclusive (sakalādhivacanaṃ).\n\n\"Complete\" (paripuṇṇanti) means neither deficient nor excessive (anūnādhikavacanaṃ).\n\nThis means that he teaches only what is entirely complete, and there is no teaching which is incomplete.\n\nIt should be understood as \"entirely complete\" (kevalaparipuṇṇanti) due to the absence of what should be introduced or removed.\n\n\"Purified\" (parisuddhanti) means without corruption (nirupakkilesaṃ).\n\nIn the case of one who teaches his Dhamma teaching (dhammadesanā) with the intention of obtaining honor (sakkāra) and gain (lābhaṃ), the teaching is impure (aparishuddha).\n\nBut the Exalted One teaches without regard for worldly ends (lokāmisanirapekkho), with a heart made gentle by the development of loving kindness (mettābhāvanāya), suffused with the welfare of others (hitapharaṇena), with a mind established in delivering others i.e. with a mind of compassionate intention fixed in the mode of lifting others up from all defilements and from the suffering of the round (ullumpanasabhāvasaṇṭhitena cittena).\n\nTherefore he is said to teach a purified Dhamma (parisuddhaṃ dhammaṃ).\n\nHe reveals the holy life (brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetīti): Here, the word “holy life” (brahmacariya-saddo) is found with the following meanings: giving (dāne), service (veyyāvacce), the moral discipline of the five precepts (pañcasikkhāpadasīle), the four immeasurable states (appamaññāsu), abstinence from sexual intercourse (methunaviratiyaṃ), contentment with one’s own marital partner (sadārasantose), energy (vīriye), the factors of the Uposatha observance (uposathaṅgesu), the noble path (ariyamagge), and the entire dispensation (sāsane).\n\nFor in this Puṇṇaka Jātaka, giving (dānaṃ) is called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\nIn this Aṅkura Peta Vatthu, service (veyyāvaccaṃ) is called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\n“In this way the spiritual life called Tittiriya came to be”—(Cūḷava. 311): In this Tittira Jātaka, the moral discipline of the five precepts (pañcasikkhāpadasīlaṃ) is called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\n“However, Pancasikha, that holy life does not lead to dis-enchantment, to dispassion, to cessation…pe… but only to birth in the Brahma-world” (D.II,329): In this Mahāgovinda Sutta, the four immeasurable states (catasso appamaññāyo) are called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\n“Others will be uncelibate; we shall be celibate here”—(M.I,83): In this Sallekha Sutta, abstinence from sexual intercourse (methunavirati) is called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\nIn the Mahādhamma Pāla Jātaka, contentment with one's own marital partner (sadārasantoso) is called the holy life (brahmacariyanti).\n\n“Sariputta, I recall having lived a holy life (brahmacariyaṃ) possessing four factors, I have practised asceticism (tapassī sudaṃ homī)” (M.I)\n1.155) In the Lomahaṃsana Sutta, *vīriyaṃ* (effort) is said to be *brahmacariyaṃ* (brahmacarya, the holy life).\n\nSimilarly, in the Nimi Jātaka, the eight-factored *uposatho* (observance day) performed through self-control is said to be *brahmacariyaṃ*.\n\n\"This, Pañcasikha, is my *brahmacariyaṃ*, entirely for aversion, for detachment, for cessation…pe… this is the Noble Eightfold Path\" (Dīgha Nikāya 2.329). In the Mahāgovinda Sutta itself, the Noble Path is said to be *brahmacariyaṃ*.\n\n\"This *brahmacariyaṃ* has become successful and prosperous, extended, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans\" (Dīgha Nikāya 3.174). In the Pāsādika Sutta, the entire dispensation comprised of the threefold training is said to be *brahmacariyaṃ*.\n\nIn this place also, this same thing is intended as *brahmacariyaṃ*.\n\nTherefore, *brahmacariyaṃ pakāsetīti* (he reveals a holy life) means he teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning…pe… fully complete and purified.\n\nAnd teaching it thus, he reveals the holy life, the entire dispensation comprised in the threefold training. Thus, the meaning here should be understood.\n\n*Brahmacariyaṃ* means conduct (cariyaṃ) that has become Brahman (brahmabhūtaṃ) in the sense of being excellent (seṭṭhaṭṭhena).\n\nOr it means the conduct of the Buddhas and others who have become Brahman (brahmabhūtānaṃ).",

    "commentary_english": "191.\n*Taṃ Dhamma* means that Dhamma which possesses the qualities that have been described.\nWhy does he mention householders first, saying, \"A householder hears,\" or (simply) \"hears?\" Because they are humble and predominant.\nGenerally, when those from noble *kṣatriya* families go forth, they become conceited because of their birth (*jātiṃ nissāya mānaṃ karonti*).\nWhen those from brahmin families go forth, they become conceited because of their knowledge of the *mantras* (*mante nissāya mānaṃ karonti*).\nWhen those from low-class families go forth, they are not able to establish themselves well because of their low birth (*attano attano vijātitāya patiṭṭhātuṃ na sakkonti*).\nBut householders’ boys, who plough the earth with sweat flowing from their armpits and backs glistening with perspiration, lack such conceit; thus they are humble and free from pride (*tādisassa mānassa abhāvato nihatamānadappā honti*).\nWhen they go forth, they do not become proud and conceited; rather, to the best of their ability, they learn the entire word of the Buddha, do the work of insight (*vipassanāya kammaṃ karontā*), and establish themselves in *Arhatship* (*arahatte patiṭṭhātuṃ*).\nAnd those who renounce and go forth from other families are not numerous, whereas those from householder families are.\nThus, because they are humble and because they are predominant, householders are mentioned first (*iti nihatamānattā ussannattā ca paṭhamaṃ gahapatiṃ niddisatīti*).\nEither in one or another, or in another of the other families.\n*Paccājāto* means *patijāto*.\nHe obtains faith in the *Tathāgata*, meaning that having heard the purified Dhamma, in the *Tathāgata*, the master of the Dhamma, he obtains faith, thinking, \"Indeed, that Blessed One is a perfectly enlightened Buddha\" (*‘‘sammāsambuddho vata so bhagavā’’ti saddhaṃ paṭilabhati*).\n*Iti paṭisañcikkhati* means thus, he reflects (*evaṃ paccavekkhati*).\nThe household life is crowded, meaning that even if a couple, husband and wife, live in a house sixty cubits on an estate of a hundred *yojanas*, household life is still “crowded” in the sense that it involves obstacles such as lust, etc. and impediments such as fields, land, etc. (*sakiñcanasapalibodhaṭṭhena gharāvāso sambādhoyeva*).\n\"It is a path of dust\" means that it is the place of the arising of the dust of lust, etc. (*rāgarajādīnaṃ uṭṭhānaṭṭhānanti mahāaṭṭhakathāyaṃ vuttaṃ*).\nThey also say that it is a path of access.\nGoing forth is like the open air, meaning that it is like the open air due to its characteristic of non-attachment. (*alagganaṭṭhena abbhokāso viyāti abbhokāso*)\nFor even if one gone forth is living in a gabled cottage, a jewel-ornamented mansion, or a celestial palace, etc, with closed doors and windows, covered by a roof, he is unhindered, unattached, unbound (*pabbajito hi kūṭāgāraratanapāsādadevavimānādīsu pihitadvāravātapānesu paṭicchannesu vasantopi neva laggati, na sajjati, na bajjhati*).\nTherefore, it was said, “Going forth is like the open air” (*‘‘abbhokāso pabbajjā’’ti*).\nFurther, household life is crowded because it gives little opportunity for wholesome activity (*kusalakiriyāya okāsābhāvato*).\nAnd it is a path of dust because, like an unchecked dust-heap, it is a place where dust collects, i.e. the dust of the defilements (*rajānaṃ kilesarajānaṃ sannipātaṭṭhānato*).\nGoing forth is like the open air in that it gives opportunity for wholesome activity as much as one pleases (*kusalakiriyāya yathāsukhaṃ okāsasabbhāvato*).\n“This is not easy…pe…let me go forth,” here is a summary of the matter: this three-fold training (*sikkhattaya*) and holy life (*brahmacariya*) must be perfectly fulfilled, even for one day without a break, so as to bring about the final state of mind (*carimakacittaṃ pāpetabbatāya ekantaparipuṇṇaṃ*), and it must be lived, even for one day, without being soiled by the impurities of defilements (*kilesamalena amalīnaṃ katvā*) so as to bring about the final state of mind (*carimakacittaṃ pāpetabbatāya ekantaparisuddhaṃ*).\n*Saṅkhalikhita* means that it should be lived like a conch that has been written on, similar to a washed conch, of like appearance. (*likhitasaṅkhasadisaṃ dhotasaṅkhasappaṭibhāgaṃ caritabbaṃ*)\nIt is not easy to live in a house (*agāraṃ ajjhāvasatā*) dwelling amidst a house (*agāramajjhe vasantena*), being utterly perfect…pe… to live, what if I were to shave off my hair and beard, and having dressed in robes, dyed the color of astringent juice (*kasāyarasapītatāya kāsāyāni*), fitting for those who live the holy life (*brahmacariyaṃ carantānaṃ anucchavikāni vatthāni*), having covered myself and put them on, having gone forth from the house, I would go forth into homelessness? (*agārasmā nikkhamitvā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyyanti*)\nHere, because that activity such as agriculture, trade, and so forth, that is beneficial to a house is called ‘belonging to a house’ (*agāriyanti vuccati*), and that does not exist for going forth, therefore, going forth should be known as ‘not belonging to a house' (*pabbajjā anagāriyanti ñātabbā*); that is, homelessness (*taṃ anagāriyaṃ*).\n\"Let me go forth\" means \"I should undertake it.\" (*pabbajeyyanti paṭipajjeyyaṃ*)",

Guarding the doors of the senses, seeing a form with the eye: here, the word \"eye\" (cakkhu) occurs sometimes referring to the Buddha-eye (buddhacakkhu), as it is said: \"He surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha (buddhacakkhunā lokaṃ volokesī)\" (Mahāvaṃsa 9). Sometimes, it refers to the universal eye (samantacakkhu), which is the knowledge of omniscience (sabbaññutañāṇa), as it is said: \"Ascend the palace of Dhamma, O greatly wise one, O universal eye! (tathūpamaṃ dhammamayaṃ, sumedha, pāsādamāruyha samantacakkhū)\" (Mahāvaṃsa 8). Sometimes, it refers to the Dhamma-eye (dharmacakkhu), which is the wisdom (paññā) of the lower three paths (ariyamaggattaya), as it is said: \"There arose in him the dust-free, stainless eye of Dhamma (virajaṃ vītamalaṃ dhammacakkhuṃ udapādī)\" (Mahāvaṃsa 16). In the phrase \"Vision arose, knowledge arose (cakkhuṃ udapādi ñāṇaṃ udapādī)\" (Mahāvaṃsa 15), the knowledge of past lives (pubbenivāsādiñāṇa) is called the wisdom-eye (paññācakkhu). In places where \"with the divine eye (dibbena cakkhunā)\" (Majjhima Nikāya 1.284) occurs, it refers to the divine eye (dibbacakkhu). In the phrase \"depending on the eye and forms (cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe cā)\", it refers to the eye as a sense organ (pasādacakkhu). Here, the word \"eye\" (cakkhu) is used to signify eye-consciousness (cakkhuviññāṇa) in the conventional sense of the eye as a sense organ (pasādacakkhuvohārena), therefore the meaning here is: \"Having seen a form with eye-consciousness (cakkhuviññāṇena rūpaṃ disvā)\". Everything else that needs to be said concerning the other terms has been said already in the *Visuddhimagga*. \"Abyāseka sukha\" means that one experiences the pure (parisuddhaṃ) happiness of higher consciousness (adhicittasukhaṃ), which is unmixed (asammissaṃ) and unblemished (abyāsekaṃ), being devoid of the blemish of defilements (kilesabyāsekavirahitattā).",

    "commentary_english": "214. In the passage about going forward (*abhikkante*) and going backward (*paṭikkante*) in what is suitable for mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññabhājanīyamhi*), going forward (*abhikkantaṃ*) means going, and going backward (*paṭikkantaṃ*) means returning. Both of these can be found in the four postures.\n\nFirst, in going, carrying the body to a position in front is called going forwards (*abhikkamati nāma*).\n\nTurning back is called turning back (*paṭikkamati nāma*).\n\nAnd in standing, one just standing and bending the body to a position in front does what is called going forwards (*abhikkamati nāma*), and one bending away behind does what is called going backwards (*paṭikkamati nāma*).\n\nLikewise, in sitting, one just sitting and moving towards the front part of the seat does what is called going forwards (*abhikkamati nāma*), and one moving back towards the back part of the seat does what is called going backwards (*paṭikkamati nāma*).\n\nThe same method applies in reclining.\n\n*Sampajanakari* = “Practicing clear comprehension.” Doing without fail all actions with clear comprehension (*sampajaññena sabba kicca kari*). Or the doing of only clear comprehension (*sampajaññasseva va kari*).\n\nHe surely performs clear comprehension in going forward etc.\n\nNowhere is he without clear comprehension.\n\nThere are these four kinds of comprehension: clear comprehension of purpose (*sātthakasampajaññaṃ*), of suitability (*sappāyasampajaññaṃ*), of resort (*gocarasampajaññaṃ*) and of non-delusion (*asammohasampajaññaṃ*).\n\nAmong these four kinds of clear comprehension, the clear comprehension of purpose (*sātthakasampajaññaṃ*) is the comprehension of purpose after considering what is worthy and not worthy, with the thought, “Is there any use to one by this going or is there not?” One does this not having gone immediately, just by the influence of the thought, at the very moment the thought of going forwards is born.\n\nAnd here, *attha* means growth in the *dharma* through visiting a *cetiya*, a *bodhi* tree, the *saṅgha*, elders, seeing something unlovely, and so on.\n\nBy visiting a relic shrine or a *bodhi* tree, and by producing spiritual interest, or by visiting the *saṅgha* and by producing spiritual interest, and by meditating on the waning of that interest, one could reach *arahantship*.\n\nBy visiting elders and by getting established in their instruction, or by visiting a place where the dead are cast, by seeing a corpse there and by producing the first absorption (*paṭhamajjhāna*) in that unlovely object, one could reach *arahantship*.\n\nSo the visiting of these is purposeful.\n\nSome however say: Increase by way of material gain, too, is purpose, since material gain is helpful for the holy life.\n\nClear comprehension of suitability (*sappāyasampajaññaṃ*) is the comprehension of the suitable after considering what is suitable and not suitable in that going.\n\nFor example, visiting a *cetiya* is a purpose of worth. Still, if, for a great festival of the *cetiya*, a crowd gathers within ten or twelve *yojanas*, and women and men, according to their means, go about adorned and arrayed like painted puppets,\n\nand if in that crowd greed could arise for the *bhikkhu* in an attractive object, resentment in a non-attractive one, and delusion through prejudice; if he could commit the offense of sexual intercourse;\n\nor if harm could come to the holy life of purity; then a place like that *cetiya* would not be suitable.\n\nIf there is an absence of dangers of the kind stated above, it is suitable.\n\nThe same rule applies in visiting a *bodhi* tree.\n\nThe visiting of the *saṅgha* is also a purpose of worth.\n\nStill, when there is all-night preaching in a big *maṇḍapa* in the inner village and there are crowds and one could possibly come to hurt and harm in the way mentioned earlier, that place of preaching is not suitable to go to.\n\nIf there is an absence of dangers, it is suitable.\n\nIn visiting elders who are surrounded by a large following, suitability and non-suitability should also be determined in the way stated above.\n\nSeeing something unlovely is also a purpose of worth. And to explain the meaning of this the following story has been told: It is said that a young *bhikkhu* went with a novice to get wood for tooth-cleaners.\n\nThe novice, getting out of the road and proceeding in front, saw a corpse. Meditating on it, he produced the first absorption (*paṭhamajjhāna*), and making the factors of the absorption a basis for developing insight, realized the first three fruitions of *arahantship*, while examining the conformations (*saṅkhāre sammasanto*), and stood having laid hold of the subject of meditation for realizing the path of full *arahantship*.\n\nThe young *bhikkhu*, not seeing the novice, called out to him.\n\nThe novice thought thus: “From the day I took up the homeless life, I have endeavored to let me never be called twice by a *bhikkhu*.\n\nOn another day, too, I will bring about a special higher attainment.” Thinking this, he gave the reply, “What is it, *bhante*?”\n\n“Come,” said the *bhikkhu*, and the novice returned. The novice told the *bhikkhu* as follows: “Go first by this way: then stand facing north, at the place I stood, for a while and look.”\n\nDoing so, he obtained that special attainment.\n\nThus, the same corpse became profitable to two people.\n\nThus, while visiting a *cetiya* can be purposeful, the unloveliness of a woman’s corpse is unsuitable for a man, and the unloveliness of a man’s corpse is unsuitable for a woman. Only a corpse of one’s own sex is suitable. Comprehension of what is suitable in this way is called the clear comprehension of suitability.\n\nFurther, the going on the alms round of that one who has thus comprehended purpose and suitability, after leaving and taking up just that resort among the thirty-eight subjects of meditation called the subject of meditation after his own heart, is clear comprehension of resort (*gocarasampajaññaṃ nāma*).\n\nTo elucidate that, this tetrad should be understood: Here, a certain *bhikkhu* takes but does not bring back; another brings back but does not take; yet another neither takes nor brings back; and yet another both takes and brings back.\n\nAmong these four kinds, there is a certain *bhikkhu* who lives thus: By day he cleanses his mind of things that becloud the hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*) through meditation on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture. By night, likewise, on the ambulatory and in the sitting posture, through meditation, in the first watch and in the last watch, he cleanses his mind of things that becloud, after sleeping in the middle watch. Quite early in the day, having done the duties connected with the terraces of\nThereafter, having looked to the needs of his body, he enters his dwelling and, during two or three sittings while the body happens to be put into a state of warming up, he applies himself to the subject of meditation. When it is time to wander for alms, he, having got up from the sitting meditation-pose, and takes his bowl and robe with just the thought of meditation uppermost in mind, leaves his dwelling and, while directing his mind to the meditation subject, goes to the shrine terrace. If it is the Buddha-recollection meditation subject, he enters the shrine terrace without dismissing that.\n\nBut should his thought of meditation be something other than the Buddha-subject, he, having stood at the foot of the stairway leading to the shrine-terrace, put by his thought of meditation as if it were goods hand-carried, and acquired the joy begotten of the Buddha-subject of meditation, goes up the stairway. If the relic-shrine is a big one, it should be worshipped at four places, when the *bhikkhu* has gone round it three times to the right.\n\nIf it is a small shrine, it should be worshipped by the meditator in eight places when he has gone round it three times to the right just as in the case of the big shrine.\n\nBy a *bhikkhu* who, having worshipped a relic-shrine, has reached a Bodhi-tree shrine even the Bodhi-tree should be worshipped. And he should worship the Bodhi-tree showing meek demeanour as though he were in the very presence of the Buddha, the *Bhagava*.\n\nIn this way, that monk, having worshipped relic-shrine and Bodhi-tree shrine, goes to the place where he had put by his first subject of meditation, namely, to the bottom of the stairway. There, having taken up the subject of meditation he had put by earlier, and robed himself , near the village with the thought of meditation uppermost in mind, he enters the village for alms.\n\nThere, people, after seeing the *bhikkhu*, say: “Our venerable one has come,” and having gone forward to meet the *bhikkhu*, taken his bowl, conducted him to the sitting-hall or to a house and made him take a seat, offer gruel to him. Thereafter, they wash and anoint his feet, and till rice is ready sit in front of him and ask him questions or become desirous of listening to a talk on the *Dhamma* from him.\n\nEven if the people do not ask him to speak to them on the *Dhamma*, the commentators say that a talk on the *Dhamma* should be given to the people in order to help them.\n\nFor, truly, there is no talk on the *Dhamma* that is devoid of a subject of meditation. Therefore, having given a talk on the *Dhamma* with the subject of meditation uppermost in his mind, having partaken of food with the subject of meditation uppermost in his mind, and having given thanks, that monk, having left the village, followed by such people who were turned back, turns them back there and sets out.\n\nThen, novices and young *bhikkhus* who had taken their meal outside the village, having left the village earlier than this *bhikkhu* see this *bhikkhu* coming. And they, after going forward to meet him, take his bowl and robe.\n\nIt is said that former *bhikkhus*, without looking at the face of their preceptor or teacher, perform the duties, but they perform them only to the extent that is appropriate.\n\nThey ask him: “Venerable Sir, what relation are these people to you, relatives on your mother’s side or on your father’s side?” Why do you ask, seeing what?\" \"Because there is much love and respect for you in them.”\n\n\"Friends, what even parents find it hard to do these people do for us. Our very robes and bowls are just due to them. Owing to these people we know no fear on occasions of fear and know no lack of food on occasions of famine.\n\nThere are no people so helpful to us as these folk.” Speaking well of these people, thus, he goes.\n\nThis *bhikkhu* is spoken of as a person who carries forth the subject of meditation when he leaves his dwelling but does not return with the thought of meditation.\n\nBut when, as that *bhikkhu* is performing the duties of conduct in the manner described above, the heat-element born of *karma* blazes up, and having relinquished what is conditioned takes hold of what is unconditioned, sweat exudes from his body, and the subject of meditation does not mount the path (of the mind), that *bhikkhu* early in the morning, having taken his bowl and robe, with speed worships a shrine, and enters the village for gruel-alms just at the time when the cows are leaving the village, obtains gruel, goes to the sitting-hall, and drinks it. Then, with just two or three mouthfuls, the heat-element born of *karma* relinquishes what is conditioned and takes hold of what is unconditioned. The heat-element, having attained the cessation of burning like one bathed with a hundred pots of water, having partaken of gruel with the subject of meditation uppermost in mind, and having washed his bowl and face, having directed his mind to the subject of meditation between meals, having wandered for alms in the remaining places, and having partaken of food with the subject of meditation uppermost in mind, from then onwards, taking up the subject of meditation that is presented to him again and again in every detail, he comes. This one is spoken of as a person who both carries back and carries forth the subject of meditation.\n\nAnd *bhikkhus*, like this one, who, after drinking gruel and exerting themselves in the development of insight, reached the state of *arahantship* in the Buddha’s Dispensation are past all numbering.\n\nIn the Island of the Lion Race alone there is not a seat of sitting-hall in the various villages which is not a place where a *bhikkhu*, having sat and drunk gruel, attained *arahantship*.\n\nBut a *bhikkhu* who is a loose liver, who is a slacker, having broken all observances whilst living spiritually frozen through the fivefold bondage of mind, having entered the village for alms without having even shown a sign of the fact that there is a subject of meditation, whilst living mixed up with the householders, through unsuitable association, having wandered and eaten, comes out empty. This *bhikkhu* is spoken of as a person who neither carries forth nor carries back the subject of meditation.\n\nWho, moreover, is spoken of with the words “This one carries forth and carries back” must be known just through the means of the observance of carrying forth and carrying back .\n\nMen of good family, desirous of self-improvement, having become homeless ones in the Dispensation of the Buddha, when living in a group of ten, twenty, fifty or a hundred make a covenant of observance, with these words: “Friends, you renounced not because you were troubled by creditors, not because of fear of punishment from the king, and not because of difficulties of subsistence produced by famine and the like, but because you were desirous of release here. Therefore, you should restrain the defilement of the mind that arises in the course of going just in the course of going, and likewise restrain the defilement of the mind that arises when standing, sitting or lying down just when standing, sitting or lying down.\"\n\nWhen, after the making of such a covenant of observance they go on to a village for alms, if there are stones, by the road, at distances of half-an-*usabha*, one *usabha* and one *gavuta*, with that thought in mind, while directing their minds to the subject of meditation they go.\n\nIf in the course of going a defilement of the mind arises in one, just in the course of going one restrains or suppresses it.\n\nIf he is unable to do so, he stops; then he who comes behind one stops too.\n\nAnd one thinks: “This *bhikkhu* here knows the unclean thought that has arisen in you; unbecoming is that to you.” Thus having reproved oneself and developed penetrative insight, one steps into the Plane of the Noble Ones; if unable to do even that, he sits down.\n\nAnd he who comes behind sits down too, it is said: that just is the method.\n\nEven if he is unable to step into the Plane of the Noble Ones, he suppresses that defilement and, directing his mind to the subject of meditation, he goes; he does not raise his foot with a mind disjoined from the subject of meditation. But should one do so, one, having turned, gets back again even to the earlier step.\n\nLike the elder *Maha Phussa*, the verandah-dweller.\n\nHe, it is said, when fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and back the subject of meditation for nineteen years, just so he continued to live. People, too, saw him, and seeing the elder going thus along the road as they were ploughing and sowing and treading and doing various jobs, derisively exclaimed: “This elder turns back again and again as he goes along; what, pray, is the reason? Is he lost or has he left something behind?\"\n\nHe, without paying attention to that, whilst doing the duties of a recluse with a mind yoked just to the subject of meditation, attained *arahantship* within twenty years. On the day he attained *arahantship*, it is said that the divinity dwelling at the corner of his walking-place lit up a lamp with her fingers and stood.\n\nThe Four Great Kings, *Sakka* the deva-king, Brahmā and *Sahampati* came to serve the elder.\n\nMaha Tissa the forest-dweller, also an elder, saw that radiance and inquired of the *arhat* the next day: “Last night, there was a radiance about your reverence; what was that?\" The elder, making an excuse, said: “Radiance may be the radiance of a lamp or the radiance of a jewel,” and so forth.\n\nThereupon, when he was pressed with the words “You are concealing,” he acknowledged, saying, “Yes,” and informed Tissa of his attainment.\n\nLike the elder *Maha Naga* of the Black Creeper Pavilion.\n\nHe, too, it is said, when fulfilling the observance of carrying forth and carrying back the subject of meditation, resolved upon keeping to only the postures of standing and of walking for seven years, with the thought: “I will honor the Blessed One’s great struggle.”\n\nAnd after fulfilling for sixteen years again the observance of carrying forth and carrying back the subject of meditation, he attained *arahantship*.\n\nHe raises his foot only with mind yoked to the subject of meditation. If he raises with mind not yoked thus, he turns back again. After standing at such a distance from the village as would raise the doubt: “Is it indeed a cow or a recluse?” and robing himself, he fills his mouth with a draught of water from the water-carrier slung over the shoulder and hanging under the armpit, having washed the bowl with water from the same source.\n\nWhat is the reason? He does it thinking: “Let there be no distraction of the mind even by the uttering of the words: ‘May you live long!’ to people coming to worship me or give me alms.”\n\nBut when he is asked the question, “Reverend Sir, which stage of the half-month is today?” concerning the date, or when he is questioned about the number of monks, he answers, after swallowing the water.\n\nIf there is no questioning about the day and so forth, he, having spat out the water at the village gate at the time of leaving, goes.\n\nLike the fifty *bhikkhus* who entered upon the rainy season residence at the Monastery of the Galamba Landing Place.They, it seems, on the Āsāḷhī full-moon day, made an agreement-observance, \"[Until] having attained *arahatship*, we will not address one another,\" and entering the village for alms, having made a mouthful of water, they entered.\n\nWhen questioned about the date and so forth, they acted just according to the method mentioned above.\n\nIn that village people, having seen the spots on which mouthfuls of water had been spurted forth, knew: “Today one came; today, two.”\n\nAnd those people thought: “What indeed is the reason that these *bhikkhus* neither talk with us nor with each other?\n\nIf they do not speak with each other, surely, they are persons who have had a dispute amongst themselves.\n\nCome, we must make them forgive one another,” went — in a body — to the monastery. There, they saw that no two *bhikkhus* were in the same place.\n\nThen a wise man in that crowd said: “Good people, a place which quarrelsome folk occupy is not like this. The relic-shrine and the Bodhi-shrine terraces are well swept. The brooms are well arranged. And water for drinking and water for washing are well set.” Then those people just turned back.\n\nAnd the *bhikkhu* of that monastery attained *arahatship* within three months and performed a Pure *Pavarana* ceremony.\n\nThus like the elder Mahā-Nāga, dweller in the Black Creeper Pavilion, and like the *bhikkhus* who went into rainy season at the Galamba Ford Monastery, the *bhikkhu* raises his foot only with mind yoked to the thought of meditation. Having reached the neighborhood of the village, filled the mouth with a draught of water, and looked at the streets, he enters the street where there are no quarrelsome drunkards, gamesters and such folk or where there are no restive elephants, horses and the like.\n\nThere, wandering for alms, he does not go speedily like one in a great hurry.\n\nSince there is no ascetic practice of begging food, speedily.\n\nHe goes, rather, having become motionless, like a water cart on uneven ground.\n\nHaving entered the neighborhood, and having ascertained whether [the householder] is in a mood to give or not to give, awaiting the suitable time, having received alms and having taken [them], having come into the village or outside the village or into the monastery itself, and having sat down in a suitable and fitting place, reflecting on the object of meditation, having established the perception of repulsiveness in food, and reflecting [on it] in terms of the loathsomeness of the rejection of the mouthful—ointment of a wound, flesh of a son—he partakes of food which is possessed of eight factors, neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for [the sake of] adornment nor for [that of] embellishment…pe… And having eaten, and having done the water-duty, having for a moment tranquillized the weariness of the meal, just as before the meal, so after the meal he applies his mind to the object of meditation itself. This is called “he who carries forth and carries back.”\n\nBut the person who fulfills this observance of one who carries forth and carries back, called the carrying forth when going out for alms and the bringing back when returning from the alms-round, reaches *arahatship* even in the period of youth, if he is possessed of the sufficing condition.\n\nIf he fails in the period of youth, then in the middle period of life; if he fails in the middle period of life, then at the time of death; if he fails at the time of death, then after becoming a deva; if he fails after becoming a deva, then, at a time when no Buddha has appeared on earth, he is born as a man and realizes the truth as a *Pratyekabuddha*.\n\nAnd if he fails to realize the truth in that way, then, immediately on meeting a Fully Enlightened Buddha he becomes a person who intuits quickly like the elder Bāhiya Dārucīriya, or a greatly wise one like the elder Sāriputta, or one of great psychic power like the elder Mahā-Moggallāna, or an exponent of ascetic practice like the elder Mahā-Kassapa, or one endowed with clairvoyant power like the elder Anuruddha, or an expert in discipline like the elder Upāli or an expounder of the Dhamma like the elder Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, or a forest-dweller like the elder Revata, or a very learned one like the elder Ānanda, or a person desiring training like the elder Rāhula, a Buddha's son.\n\nThus, in this tetrad, whoever both carries forth and carries back, for him the clear comprehension of resort reaches its peak.\n\nBut non-confusion in going forward, etc., is the clear comprehension of non-delusion; that should be understood thus: here, a *bhikkhu*, whether going forward or turning back, just as blind, childish ordinary people are confused about going forward, etc., [thinking] either: “The self goes forward; the going forward is produced by the self,” or: “I go forward, the going forward is produced by me,” so, not being confused in that way, when the thought: “I am going forward” arises in the mind, just with that thought, the oscillation process of the wind-element originating from mind arises generating bodily expression.\n\nThus by the way of the diffusion of the process of oscillation due to mental activity, this skeleton called the body goes forward.\n\nIn that going forward of his, in the lifting up of each foot, two processes—the earth-element and the water-element—are low and sluggish, the other two are predominant and strong; likewise in over-extension and retraction.\n\nIn lowering down, two processes—the fire-element and the air-element—are low and sluggish, the other two are predominant and strong; likewise in bending in and straightening out.\n\nTherein, the phenomena of form and formlessness that are occurring in the lifting up do not reach the over-extension; likewise, the phenomena that are occurring in the over-extension do not reach the retraction; the phenomena that are occurring in the retraction do not reach the lowering down; the phenomena that are occurring in the lowering down do not reach the bending in; the phenomena that are occurring in the bending in do not reach the straightening out.\n\nThere, just in those very places, after coming into existence in the form of sections and junctures and parts, they break quickly crackling like sesamum seeds thrown into a heated pan.\n\nThere, who is it that goes forward, or to whom does the going forward belong? In the ultimate sense, indeed, it is just a going of the elements, a standing of the elements, a sitting of the elements, a lying down of the elements.\n\nIn that particular section, together with form.\n\n\"The meaning of the expression is: He is accomplished being clearly comprehending in going forward and in turning back.\n\nIn looking straight on and in looking away, here, looking straight on means seeing in the direction in front of oneself.\n\nLooking away means seeing in another direction.\n\nAnd other kinds of seeing, by way of turning the eye in the direction above, in the direction beneath and in the direction behind are called looking upwards, looking downwards and looking backwards. Here those are not taken.\n\nBut just these two — looking straight on and looking away from the front — are taken, by way of what is befitting. Or, by this method, it is said, all those are also taken.\n\nTherein, when the thought: “I will look” has arisen in the mind, the grasping of meaning without looking with the mind alone is clear comprehension with a purpose; that should be known by making the venerable Nanda a witness of the body.\n\nThe Exalted One said that “if, *bhikkhus*, the eastern direction were to be looked at by Nanda, having applied all his mind, Nanda looks at the eastern direction thinking: 'Thus may covetousness and dejection, evil and unskillful mental states not flow in upon me while I am looking in the eastern direction.'\n\nThus he is possessed of full awareness therein.\"\n\n(A.Ni.\n8.\n9).\n\n“If, *bhikkhus*, the western direction…pe…the northern direction…pe…the southern direction…pe…the direction above…pe…the direction beneath…pe…the intermediate directions were to be looked around at by Nanda, having applied all his mind, Nanda looks around in the intermediate directions thinking: 'Thus may covetousness and dejection, evil and unskillful mental states not flow in upon me while I am looking around in the intermediate directions.'\n\nThus he is possessed of full awareness therein.”\n\nMoreover, here also, lawfulness and suitability should be understood just as in the previously stated case of seeing a shrine, etc.; but the non-abandoning of the object of meditation is just the clear comprehension of resort.\n\nTherefore, here, by those who have as their object of meditation the aggregates, elements and sense-bases, looking and looking away should be done just by way of their own object of meditation; or, for those who have as their object of meditation the *kasina*, etc., it should be done just with the object of meditation at the head.\nWithin, there is certainly no self or soul (*ātman*) that looks straight on or looks away from the front. Still, at the arising of the thought “I shall look straight on,” and with that thought the process of oscillation originating from mind, *citta samutthana*, bringing into being bodily expression *viññatti* arises.\n\nThus owing to the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity *cittakiriyavāyodhātuvipphāra*, the lower eyelid goes down and the upper eyelid goes up.\n\nSurely there is no one who opens with a contrivance.\n\nThereupon, eye-consciousness (*cakkhuviññāṇa*) arises fulfilling the function of sight (*dassanakiccaṃ*), it is said.  Thus knowing this is called clear comprehension of non-delusion (*asammohasampajañña*) here.\n\nFurther, clear comprehension of non-delusion should be understood, by way of the accurate knowledge of the root (*mūlapariññā*) as adventitious and as momentary.\n\nIn the first instance, by way of the accurate knowledge of the root (*mūlapariññā*) – there, the life-continuum (*bhavaṅga*) goes on fulfilling the function of a factor of the rebirth-process (*upapattibhava*); after the turning round of the life-continuum, a barely active mind process (*kiriyamanodhātu*), fulfilling the function of adverting or attending to an object (*āvajjana kiccaṃ*) at the sense-door of the eye, goes on; from the cessation of that, fulfilling the function of seeing, eye-consciousness (*cakkhuviññāṇa*) arises; from the cessation of that, a resultant mind process (*vipākamanodhātu*) fulfilling the function of receiving (*sampaṭicchana kiccaṃ*) arises; from the cessation of that, a resultant mind-consciousness element (*vipākamanoviññāṇadhātu*) fulfilling the function of investigating (*santīraṇa kiccaṃ*) arises; from the cessation of that, a barely active mind-consciousness element (*kiriyamanoviññāṇadhātu*) fulfilling the function of determining (*voṭṭhabbana kiccaṃ*) arises, from the cessation of that, impulsion (*javanaṃ*) flashes seven times.\n\nNow, even in the mental state of the first impulsion (*paṭhamajavana*), there is no looking straight on or looking away from the front, by way of lust (*rajjana*), hatred (*dussana*) or ignorance (*muyhana*) along with the discriminatory thought: “This is a woman, this is a man.”\n\nAlso there is no such stained vision by him in the mental state of the second impulsion, the third, the fourth, the fifth, sixth or even in the seventh impulsion.\n\nBut when, like soldiers in a battlefield, the mental states, after breaking-up gradually are fallen, one atop of another, there takes place looking straight on or looking away from the front, by way of lust and so forth, accompanied by the discriminatory thought: “This is a woman,” or “This is a man.”\n\nThus here in the first instance, clear comprehension of non-delusion (*asammohasampajañña*) should be understood, by way of the accurate knowledge of the root (*mūlapariññā*).\n\nAt the eye-door, when a visible object comes into the range [of vision], after the disturbance of the life-continuum, after the states of adverting and so forth arising by way of fulfilling each one's function are ceased, at the end impulsion (*javanaṃ*) arises, that is just like a chance visitor in the eye-door house of the previously arisen states of adverting and so forth.\n\nJust as it is unfit for a chance visitor, who has entered another's house in order to beg something, to command in the house of those householders who are seated in silence, even so, it is unfit for impulsion to be involved in lust, hate and ignorance, at the eye-door house of adverting and the other states of mind, when those states of mind are themselves not lusting, hating or bound up with ignorance. Clear comprehension of non-delusion should thus be known by way of the casual state.\n\nAt the eye-door, the mental states that close with the state of determining (*voṭṭhabbana*) arise and break up together with associated phenomena, at just those places on which they arise. They do not see each other. Therefore the mental states that close with determining are brief and temporary.\n\nThere, just as in a house where all the people are dead, it is unfit for the one remaining, who is subject to death at that very moment, to take delight in dancing and singing and the like.\n\nEven so, at a sense-door, when the states of adverting and the rest with associated phenomena have died just where they arose, it is not fit for the remaining impulsion (*javana*) that is subject to death shortly to take delight in anything by way of lust, hatred or ignorance.\n\nClear comprehension of non-delusion (*asammohasampajañña*) should be understood thus by way of the momentary state.\n\nFurther, this should be understood by way of reflection on the aggregates (*khandha*), bases (*āyatana*), processes (*dhātu*) and conditions (*paccaya*).\n\nTo be sure, here, eye (*cakkhu*) and visible object (*rūpa*) are materiality-aggregate (*rūpakkhandha*); seeing (*dassanaṃ*) is consciousness-aggregate (*viññāṇakkhandha*); feeling (*vedanā*) that is associated with seeing is feeling-aggregate (*vedanākkhandha*); perceiving (*saññā*) is perception-aggregate (*saññākkhandha*), and those beginning with sense-impression (*phassa*) are formation-aggregate (*saṅkhārakkhandha*).\n\nThus looking-straight-on-and-looking-away-from-the-front is seen in the combination of these five aggregates (*khandha*).\n\nThere, who is it that is looking straight on? Who is it that is looking away from the front? In the same way, eye (*cakkhu*) is eye-base (*cakkhāyatanaṃ*), visible object (*rūpaṃ*) is visible-object-base (*rūpāyatanaṃ*), seeing (*dassanaṃ*) is mind-base (*manāyatanaṃ*), feeling (*vedanā*) and so forth are associated phenomena (*sampayuttadhammā*) [and] are phenomenon-base (*dhammāyatanaṃ*).\n\nThus looking-straight-on-and-looking-away-from-the-front is seen in the combination of these four bases (*āyatana*).\n\nThere, who is it that is looking straight on? Who is it that is looking away from the front? In the same way, eye (*cakkhu*) is eye-element (*cakkhudhātu*), visible object (*rūpaṃ*) is visible-object-element (*rūpadhātu*), seeing (*dassanaṃ*) is eye-consciousness-element (*cakkhuviññāṇadhātu*), feeling (*vedanā*) and so forth which are associated phenomena (*sampayuttadhammā*) are phenomenon-element (*dhammadhātu*).\n\nThus looking-straight-on-and-looking-away-from-the-front is seen in the combination of these four elements (*dhātu*).\n\nThere, who is it that is looking straight on? Who is it that is looking away from the front? In the same way, eye (*cakkhu*) is dependence-condition (*nissayapaccayo*), visible objects (*rūpā*) are object-condition (*ārammaṇapaccayo*), adverting (*āvajjanaṃ*) is contiguity-and-absence-condition (*anantarasamanantarūpanissayanatthivigatapaccayo*), light (*āloko*) is support-condition (*upanissayapaccayo*), feeling (*vedanā*) and so forth are co-nascent-condition (*sahajātapaccayo*).\n\nThus looking-straight-on-and-looking-away-from-the-front is seen in the combination of these conditions (*paccaya*).\n\nThere, who is it that is looking straight on? Who is it that is looking away from the front, it is said? In this way, by reflection on the aggregates, bases, processes, and conditions, too, clear comprehension of non-delusion (*asammohasampajañña*) should be understood.\n\n“In bending [the limbs] and in stretching [them]” means in the bending and the stretching of the joints (*pabbānaṃ*).\n\nThe consideration of purpose and lack of purpose (*attha anattha*) in regard to any contemplated act of bending or stretching, and the taking up of that which is purposeful, after not bending and stretching according to merely the mind’s inclination (*citta*), is clear comprehension of purpose (*sātthakasampajaññaṃ*).\n\nIn this matter, a person who experiences pain (*vedanā*) every moment due to standing long with bent or stretched hands or feet does not get concentration of mind (*cittaṃ ekaggataṃ*), his subject of meditation (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ*) entirely falls away, and he does not obtain distinction (*visesaṃ*).\n\nBut he who bends or stretches his hands and feet for the proper length of time does not experience those pains (*vedanā*), gets concentration of mind (*cittaṃ ekaggaṃ hoti*), develops his subject of meditation (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ phātiṃ gacchati*) and attains distinction (*visesamadhigacchati*). Thus the comprehension of purpose and non-purpose (*attha anattha*) should be known.\n\nClear comprehension of suitability (*sappāyasampajaññaṃ*) is the comprehension of the suitable (*sappāya pariggaṇhanaṃ*) after considering the suitable (*sappāya*) and the non-suitable (*asappāya*) even in a matter that is purposeful (*atthe pana sati*).\n\nOn that occasion, this is the story: it is said that young monks were reciting in the Great Courtyard of the *cetiya*, and that young nuns were listening to the *dhamma* on the side behind them.\n\nThere, a certain young [monk] in stretching out his hand, came into bodily contact (*kāyasaṃsaggaṃ*) [with a nun], and, by just that fact, became a layman (*gihī jāto*).\n\nAnother monk in stretching his foot stretched it into fire and his foot got burnt to the bone.\n\nAnother stretched his foot on an ant-hill and was bitten in the foot by a poisonous snake (*āsīvisa*).\n\nAnother monk stretched out his hand until it rested on the pole of a robe-tent (*cīvarakuṭi*), [and] a ribbon-snake (*maṇisappa*) on the pole bit [his] hand.\n\nTherefore the stretching of one’s limbs should be done in a suitable (*sappāya*) and not an unsuitable (*asappāya*) place.\n\nThis should be understood here as clear comprehension of suitability (*sappāyasampajaññaṃ*).\n\nClear comprehension of resort (*gocarasampajaññaṃ*) should indeed be illustrated by the story of the senior bhikkhu called Great Elder: it is said that Great Elder seated in his day-quarters (*divāṭhāne*) bent his arm quickly whilst talking to his resident pupils (*antevāsika*) and then after putting back his arm to the position in which it first was, bent it again slowly.\n\nThen the resident pupils (*antevāsika*) asked him: “Venerable Sir (*bhante*), why did you quickly bend your arm and then after putting it back to the position in which it first was, bend it again slowly?” [The Great Elder replied:] “Since the time that I began to attend to [my] subject of meditation (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ manasikātuṃ āradho*), friends (*āvuso*), my arm has never been bent without abandoning [my] subject of meditation (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ muñcitvā*); now, however, whilst I was talking with you, it was bent having abandoned [my] subject of meditation (*kammaṭṭhānaṃ muñcitvā*).\"\nTherefore, again, having placed [it] in its proper place, they may contract [it].\n“Good! Reverend Sir. A *bhikkhu* should be one who acts thus.”\nHere, too, it should be understood that the non-abandoning of the subject of meditation is clear comprehension of resort.\nWithin, there is no self (*ātmā*) contracting or extending. But contraction and extension occur through the diffusion of the mind-activity-wind-element in the manner described, like the movement of the hands and feet of a wooden puppet by means of pulling strings. Thus, understanding this is clear comprehension of non-delusion here.\n*Saṅghāṭi-patta-cīvara-dhāraṇa* means that here, the use of the *saṅghāṭi* robes for dwelling and covering, and the bowl for receiving alms, etc., is called wearing.\nIn this connection, concerning the wearing of the *saṅghāṭi* robe, the material gain to one who lives depending on alms, after dwelling or covering oneself, with a method beginning with \"for the warding off of cold,\" the Blessed One said, \"purpose\" is the meaning.\nAs such should clear comprehension of purpose be known.\nSuitable for one who is naturally warm-bodied and for one who is weak is fine clothing, while suitable for one who is cold-natured is thick double cloth.\nThe opposite is unsuitable.\nWhatever is old is unsuitable for anyone; due to giving locks, etc., it is a cause of obstruction for him.\nLikewise, hindrance-causing are robes of silk, fine hemp and similar material that stimulate cupidity.\nFor the lone-dweller in the forest, such robes are productive of loss of clothing and of life.\nThe robe acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the robe which decreases the good and increases the bad in the one who wears it, are irreversibly not suitable.\nThe opposite is suitable.\nThrough this explanation, clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understood.\nBy the non-abandoning of the subject of meditation, clear comprehension of resort should be understood.\nWithin, there is no self (*ātmā*) draping the robe. But the draping of the robe occurs merely through the diffusion of the mind-activity-wind-element in the manner described.\nThere, the robe has no consciousness, and the body has no consciousness.\nThe robe does not know, “I am draped around the body.”\nThe body does not know, “I am draped with a robe.”\nJust elements clothe a heap of elements, as in the covering of a modeled figure with a piece of cloth.\nTherefore, there is neither room for elation on getting a fine robe nor for depression on getting one that is not fine.\nSome honor an ant-hill where a cobra de capello lives, a shrine, a tree, and so forth with garlands, perfumes, incense, cloth, and similar things. Others maltreat these objects with excrement, urine, mud, sticks, knives, blows, and similar things.\nThe ant-hill, tree, and the like are neither elated by the good nor depressed by the bad treatment.\nJust in the same way there should be no elation on receiving a good robe or depression on getting a bad one. Clear comprehension of non-delusion should be understood, in this connection, as the proceeding of reflective thought.\nIn using the bowl, clear comprehension of purpose should be understood, by way of the benefit obtainable through the action of one who takes the bowl unhurriedly and thinks: “Going out to beg with this I shall get alms.”\nBut for one whose body is thin and weak, a heavy bowl is unsuitable; for whomever a bowl with four or five patches is difficult to clean is just unsuitable.\nA bowl that is hard to wash well is not fit. There will be inconvenience caused to him who washes that kind of bowl.\nA bowl the color of a jewel is desirable, just unsuitable as robes were said to be. Moreover, a bowl acquired by wrong means of livelihood, and by which the one who uses it increases unwholesome things and decreases wholesome things, is just irreversibly unsuitable.\nThe opposite is suitable.\nThrough this explanation, clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understood.\nBy the non-abandoning of the subject of meditation, clear comprehension of resort should be understood.\nWithin, there is no self (*ātmā*) taking the bowl. But the taking of the bowl occurs merely through the diffusion of the mind-activity-wind-element in the manner described.\nThere, the bowl has no consciousness, and the hands have no consciousness.\nThe bowl does not know, “I am taken by the hands.”\nThe hands do not know, “We are taken by the bowl.”\nJust elements take a heap of elements, as when taking a red-hot vessel with tongs.\nClear comprehension of non-delusion should be understood in this connection, as the proceeding of reflective thought.\nAnd further, it is like this: When kindly people see, in a refuge for the helpless, unfortunate persons with hands and feet cut off and with blood, pus, and many maggots in the open wounds, and thickly covered with blue flies, and give to the unfortunate persons bandages and medicine in containers,\nThere, some of the bandages and cloths are fine, and some are thick.Some may receive thin and well-shaped bandages and medicine containers, while others receive poorly shaped ones; the sufferers will not be elated or depressed about the kind of bandages and containers they receive.\n\nThat is because they merely want cloth to cover their wounds and containers for keeping medicine.\n\nNow, the *bhikkhu* who regards the robe as a bandage, the bowl as a medicine-container, and alms-food as medicine in the bowl, should be understood as pre-eminently practicing clear comprehension of non-delusion in wearing the double-robe, bowl, and robe.\n\nIn the case of *asita* and so forth, *asita* refers to eating alms-food.\n\n*Pīta* refers to drinking rice-gruel and the like.\n\n*Khāyita* refers to chewing flour cakes and the like.\n\n*Sāyita* refers to savoring honey, molasses, and the like.\n\nThere, the meaning which was spoken of by the method beginning with \"never through burning\" and so forth, is called eight-fold meaning.\n\nAs such should clear comprehension of purpose be known.\n\nNon-suitable to one is the food by which to that one there is discomfort, whatever the food may be in quality or taste: coarse or fine or bitter or sweet or anything else.\n\nJust irreversibly non-suitable are these: the food acquired by wrong means of livelihood and the food by which good decreases and evils increase in one who partakes of it; the opposite is suitable.\n\nThrough this explanation, clear comprehension of suitability in this connection should be understood.\n\nAnd by the fact even of the holding fast to the subject of meditation should clear comprehension of resort be understood.\n\nWithin there is no eater called a self. As stated already, by the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity, only, there is the receiving of food in the bowl.\n\nBy the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity, only, there is the descent of the hand into the bowl.\n\nBy the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity, only, the making of the food into suitable lumps, the raising of the lumps from the bowl, and the opening of the mouth take place. No one opens the jaws with a key or a contrivance.\n\nBy the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity, only, take place the putting of a lump of food in the mouth, the pestle-action of the upper row of teeth, the mortar-work of the lower row of teeth, and the tongue’s activity comparable to that of the hand.\n\nThus that lump of food in the mouth is mixed together with the thin saliva at the end of the tongue and the thick saliva at the root of the tongue.\n\nThat food in the mortar of the lower teeth, turned by the tongue, moistened by the saliva, and ground fine by the pestle of the upper teeth is not put into the stomach by anyone with a ladle or a spoon. Just by the process of oscillation it goes on.\n\nThere is no one within who having made a straw mat is bearing each lump that goes in. Each lump stands by reason of the process of oscillation.\n\nThere is no one who having put up an oven and lit a fire is cooking each lump standing there. By only the process of caloricity the lump of food matures.\n\nThere is no one who expels each digested lump with a stick or pole. Just the process of oscillation expels the digested food.\n\nIt is oscillation *vāyodhātu* that does the taking onward, the moving away from side to side; and it is oscillation that bears, turns round, pulverizes, causes the removal of liquidity, and expels.\n\nExtension *pathavīdhātu* also does bearing up, turning round, pulverizing and the removal of liquidity.\n\nCohesion (*āpodhātu*) moistens and preserves wetness.\n\nCaloricity (*tejodhātu*) ripens or digests the food that goes in.\n\nSpace (*ākāsadhātu*) becomes the way for the entering of the food.\n\nConsciousness (*viññāṇadhātu*) as a consequence of right kind of action knows in any particular situation.\n\nAccording to reflection of this sort, should the clear comprehension of non-delusion be understood here.\n\nFurther, the clear comprehension of non-delusion should be understood through reflection on the unpleasantness connected with food, in the following ten ways: By way of the need to go to get it , to seek it , the process of eating it , by way of the receptacle , by way of the belly , by way of food that is undigested , by way of food that is digested , by way of the consequences of eating , by way of the trickling or oozing of food from the body’s openings in the form of excretions , and by way of the smearing of the body with it .\n\nThe detailed account here should be taken from the section on the perception of the unpleasantness of food in the *Visuddhimagga*.\n\n\"In defecating and urinating\" means in the doing of defecation and urination.\n\nIf one does not defecate or urinate at the right time, then, sweat exudes from one’s entire body, one’s eyes become dizzy, one’s mind is not unified, and other diseases arise.\n\nIf, however, one does it, all that does not happen. That is the meaning here.\n\nAs such should clear comprehension of purpose be known.\n\nIf one defecates or urinates in an unsuitable place, there is an offense, one's glory decreases, there is danger to one's life; if one defecates or urinates in a suitable place, all that does not happen. This is suitability here. As such, clear comprehension of suitability should be understood.\n\nAnd by the fact even of the holding fast to the subject of meditation should clear comprehension of resort be understood.\n\nWithin there is no self who does the act of defecating and urinating. By the diffusion of the process of oscillation born of mental activity, only, the act of defecating and urinating takes place.\n\nJust as in a matured boil, by the bursting of the boil, pus and blood come out without any kind of wishing to come out.\n\nJust as from an overfull water-pot water comes out without any desire for coming out.\nThus, feces and urine, collected in the receptacles of the bladder and bowels, emerge even against one's will, propelled by the force of wind.\n\nCertainly, this feces and urine that emerges thus is neither that *bhikkhu*'s own, nor another's; it is merely a bodily secretion.\n\nHow is it? Just as when one empties old water from a water gourd, that water is neither one's own nor another's; it is merely a matter of discarding it. Likewise, clear comprehension of non-delusion should be understood here by way of the arising and reflective contemplation.\n\nIn the context of going and so forth, \"going\" means in the act of going.\n\n\"Standing\" means in a place.\n\n\"Sitting\" means in some position.\n\n\"Sleeping\" means in sleeping.\n\n\"Awakening\" means in waking.\n\n\"Speaking\" means in speaking.\n\n\"Keeping silent\" means in not speaking.\n\nBy the words: \"When he is going, a *bhikkhu* understands, 'I am going,' and so forth,\" postures of long duration are indicated in this *sūtra*.\n\nAnd by the words, \"in going forwards and backwards... in bending and in stretching,\" postures of middling duration [are indicated] in this [sūtra].\n\nAnd by the words, \"in walking, in standing... in sleeping, in waking,\" postures of short, brief duration are indicated here.\n\nTherefore, in these [three parts of the instruction], the practicing of clear comprehension should be known even by the method stated here.\n\nThe Elder Tipiṭaka Mahā Siva indeed said: Who, after walking or exercising for a long time in the ambulatory, stands and reflects: \"The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of exercises on the ambulatory ended just there on the ambulatory,\" is called a doer of clear comprehension in walking.\n\nWhen, after standing for a long time in study or answering a question or minding a subject of meditation, [one] sits and reflects: \"The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of standing ended just at the time of standing,\" [that person] is called a doer of clear comprehension in standing.\n\nWho, after sitting for a long time in study or other similar work, gets up and reflects: \"The bodily and mental things which existed when sitting ended just at the time of sitting,\" is called a doer of clear comprehension in sitting.\n\nWho, after lying down, falls asleep, and, then, after getting up from his sleep, reflects: \"The bodily and mental things which existed during the time of sleep ended just during sleep,\" is called a doer of clear comprehension in sleeping and waking.\n\nThe non-occurrence of processes which make action or are made of action is sleep; the occurrence, waking.\n\nHe who, whilst speaking, thinks: \"This sound arises dependent on the lips, teeth, tongue, palate, and the act of the mind that accords to that sound,\" speaks, mindful and clearly comprehending.\n\nHe who for a long time has studied or expounded the Teaching or recited the words of the subject of meditation, or cleared a question, and later, on becoming silent, thinks: \"The bodily and mental things which arose during the time of speaking ended just then,\" is called a doer of clear comprehension in speaking.\n\nHe who, after remaining silent for a long time considering the Teaching or his subject of meditation, thinks that the bodily and mental things that existed in the time of silence ended just then, that the occurrence of derived material qualities is speech, and that the non-occurrence of these is silence, is called a doer of clear comprehension in keeping silence.\n\nFor when there is the occurrence of derived material qualities, one speaks; when there is non-occurrence, one is silent.\n\nThis dominance of non-delusion stated by the Elder Mahā Siva is intended here in this Discourse on the Arousing of Mindfulness (*Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta*).\n\nBut in the Discourse on the Fruit of the Homeless Life (*Sāmaññaphala*), even the entire fourfold clear comprehension is found.\n\nTherefore, in the method stated, here, the state of doing clear comprehension should be understood by way of the four clear comprehensions.\n\nIn all statements, the meaning of the term \"doer of clear comprehension (*sampajānakārī*)\" should be understood by way of only clear comprehension that is endowed with mindfulness (*sati*).\n\n\"Endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension (*satisampajaññena samannāgato*)\"—this is the expansion of that term.\n\nIndeed, in the Book of Classifications (*Vibhaṅgappakaraṇa*), these are put just in this way: \"One goes forward, mindful and clearly comprehending; one goes backwards, mindful and clearly comprehending.\"\n\nThus, great king, the meaning is that he who, by way of mindfulness combined with clear comprehension, maintains the going forward and so forth, is said to be endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.",

    "commentary_english": "215.\nHere, great king, when it is said that a *bhikkhu* is content, it means that the content is endowed with contentment regarding the conditions, one after the other.\n\nBut that contentment is twelvefold; that is to say, threefold with regard to robes ( *cīvara*): contentment with whatever robes one obtains (*yathālābhasantoṣa*), contentment with the strength (to obtain robes) (*yathābalasantoṣa*), and contentment with what is befitting regarding robes (*yathāsāruppasantoṣa*).\n\nAnd similarly in the cases of alms food (*piṇḍapāta*), and so on.\n\nHere is a commentary on the divisions of it. Here a *bhikkhu* obtains a robe (*cīvara*), and whether it is a fine one or not,\n\nhe makes do with only that, wishing for no other, and he does not use any other even if he gets one: this is his ‘contentment with what one gets’ in the case of the robe (*cīvara*).\n\nOn the other hand, he may be naturally weak, or overcome by sickness and old age, and then he is wearied when wearing a heavy robe (*garucīvaraṃ*).\n\nThen he is quite content to exchange it for a light one with a *bhikkhu* who is in communion and to live using that one: this is his ‘contentment with one’s own strength’ in the case of the robe (*cīvara*).\n\nAnother is the one who obtains requisites that are excellent (*paṇītapaccayalābhī*).\n\nHe may obtain a valuable bowl-robe, or many bowl-robes. He gives these away, thinking, \"May this bowl-robe belong to those elder monks who have long been ordained, may this belong to those who have learned much, may this be fitting for the sick, may this belong to those who gain little.\" Then, either taking their old robes or picking out unwanted rags from a rubbish heap, he makes an outer robe (*saṅghāṭi*) from them and wears it, being content.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what is befitting’ in the case of the robe (*cīvara*).\n\nHere again a *bhikkhu* obtains alms food (*piṇḍapāta*), and whether it is coarse (*lūkhaṃ*) or superior (*paṇītaṃ*), he uses only that, and, wishing for no other, he does not use any other even if he gets it: this is his ‘contentment with what one gets’ in the case of the alms food (*piṇḍapāta*).\n\nOn the other hand, if he gets alms food (*piṇḍapāta*) that is against his nature or against his illness, by which he becomes uncomfortable when he has eaten it,\n\nthen he is content to give it to a *bhikkhu* who is in communion and to accept congenial food (*sappāyabhojanaṃ*) at his hands and so be able to do his work upon the monks’ True Ideal. This is his ‘contentment with one’s own strength’ in the case of the alms food (*piṇḍapāta*).\n\nAnother obtains much alms food (*piṇḍapāta*) that is superior (*paṇītaṃ*).\n\nHe gives it away, like robes, to those elder monks who have long been ordained, who have learned much, who gain little, or who are sick, and he is content to live on whatever they give him in return, or having gone for alms and eating mixed food.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what is befitting’ in the case of the alms food (*piṇḍapāta*).\n\nHere again a *bhikkhu* obtains a resting-place (*senāsanaṃ*), and whether it is pleasing (*manāpaṃ*) or unpleasing (*amanāpaṃ*), he does not arouse joy (*somanassaṃ*) or displeasure (*domanassaṃ*); he is satisfied with even a grass mat (*tiṇasanthārakenapi*) that he has obtained.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what one gets’ in the case of the resting-place (*senāsanaṃ*).\n\nOn the other hand, if he gets a resting-place (*senāsanaṃ*) that is against his nature or against his illness, where he is uncomfortable living, then he is quite content to give it to a *bhikkhu* who is in communion, and to live in a congenial resting-place (*sappāyasenāsane*) that the other possesses.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with one’s own strength’ in the case of the resting-place (*senāsanaṃ*).\n\nAnother, greatly meritorious, obtains many superior resting-places (*paṇītasenāsanāni*), such as caves, open halls, and peaked houses (*leṇamaṇḍapakūṭāgārādīni*).\n\nHe gives them away, like robes, to those elder monks who have long been ordained, who have learned much, who gain little, or who are sick, and he is content to live wherever he may be.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what is befitting’ in the case of the resting-place (*senāsanaṃ*).\n\nEven the one who does not accept even a lodging that he has obtained, reflecting that \"a superior lodging is a place of heedlessness; drowsiness overtakes one who is sitting there, and sensual thoughts arise in one who is overcome by sleep when one wakes up again\".\n\nHaving rejected that, he is content to live in the open air, at the foot of a tree (*abbhokāsarukkhamūlādīsu*), and so on.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what is befitting’ in the case of the lodging.\n\nHere again a *bhikkhu* obtains medicine (*bhesajjaṃ*), and whether it is coarse (*lūkhaṃ*) or superior (*paṇītaṃ*), he is satisfied with whatever he obtains, wishing for no other, and he does not use any other even if he gets it:\n\nthis is his ‘contentment with what one gets’ in the case of the requisite of medicine (*gilānapaccaye*).\n\nOn the other hand, he may get molasses (*phāṇitaṃ*) when he is in need of oil (*telena*).\n\nThen he is quite content to give that to a *bhikkhu* who is in communion, and after taking oil (*telaṃ*) at his hands and seeking out something else, he is content to make up a medicine.\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with one’s own strength’ in the case of the requisite of medicine (*gilānapaccaye*).\n\nAnother, greatly meritorious, obtains much superior medicine (*paṇītabhesajjaṃ*), such as oil, honey, molasses, and so on (*telamadhuphāṇitādipaṇītabhesajjaṃ*).\n\nHe gives it away, like robes, to those elder monks who have long been ordained, who have learned much, who gain little, or who are sick, and he is content to live using whatever they give him in return.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone places a myrobalan fruit preserved in urine (*muttaharīṭakaṃ*) in one bowl and the four sweets (*catumadhuraṃ*) in another, saying, “Take whichever you want, *bhante*,” and if his illness subsides by means of any one of them, then, thinking that only the myrobalan fruit preserved in urine (*muttaharīṭakaṃ*) is praised by the Buddhas, he rejects the four sweets (*catumadhuraṃ*) and is exceedingly content to make medicine only with the myrobalan fruit preserved in urine (*muttaharīṭakeneva*).\n\nThis is his ‘contentment with what is befitting’ in the case of the requisite of medicine (*gilānapaccaye*).\nFurthermore, a *bhikkhu* endowed with this twelvefold \"contentment with requisites of any kind\" may make use of eight requisites: three robes (*cīvara*), an almsbowl (*patta*), a knife for cutting toothwood (*dantakaṭṭhacchedanavāsi*), a needle (*sūci*), a waistband (*kāyabandhanaṃ*), and a water-strainer (*parissāvana*).\n\nIt has also been said: all these have the purpose of \"protecting one's body\" (*kāyaparਿਹārīka*) and \"sustaining one's belly\" (*kucchiparihārika*).\n\nHow so? If, when one travels about, one wears the three robes, one sustains and protects the body; thus these are for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīkaṃ hoti*).\n\nIf, when drinking, one first strains the water with a corner of a robe (*cīvarakaṇṇena*), or uses a robe to accept fruits to be eaten, one sustains and protects the belly; thus these are for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihārikaṃ hoti*).\n\nThe almsbowl (*patto*) is for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīka*) if one uses it to draw water when bathing or making plaster for one’s hut.\n\nIt is for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihāriko*) when one uses it to receive food at meal time.\n\nThe knife (*vāsi*) is for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīka*) if one uses it to cut toothwood or to smoothen the legs and surface of one’s bed and chair or the poles of a tent.\n\nIt is for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihārika*) if one uses it to cut sugarcane or to open a coconut, etc. (*ucchuchedananāḷikerāditacchanakāle*).\n\nThe needle (*sūci*) is for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīka*) when one uses it to sew robes.\n\nIt is for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihārika*) if, at the time of eating, one uses it to pick up a piece of fruit or cake.\n\nThe waistband (*kāyabandhanaṃ*) is for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīkaṃ*) when one wears it while travelling.\n\nIt is for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihārikaṃ*) if one binds sugarcane etc. (*ucchuādīni*) when accepting it.\n\nThe water-strainer (*parissāvana*) is for protecting the body (*kāyaparਿਹārīka*) when one strains water with it at the time of bathing or making plaster for one’s dwelling.\n\nIt is for sustaining the belly (*kucchiparihāriyaṃ*) when one uses it to strain drinking water (*pānīyaṃ*) or to accept sesame seeds, rice grains, or honey-tree fruits while eating.\n\nThis is the limit of requisites for one using eight requisites (*aṭṭhaparikkhārika*).\n\nBut for one using nine requisites (*navaparikkhārika*), when he stays in a bedroom, a bedspread situated there or a key is allowed.\n\nFor one using ten requisites (*dasaparikkhārika*), a sitting couch or a piece of leather is allowed.\n\nFor one using eleven requisites (*ekādasaparikkhārika*), a walking stick or an oil tube is allowed.\n\nFor one using twelve requisites (*dvādasaparikkhārika*), an umbrella or a pair of sandals is allowed.\n\nIt should not be said that, of these *bhikkhus*, only the one who uses eight requisites (*aṭṭhaparikkhārika*) is content, and that the others are not content, have many desires (*mahiccha*), and are difficult to support (*mahābhārā*).\n\nFor they, too, are content, have few desires (*appiccha*), are easy to support (*subhara*), and light in their mode of living (*sallahukavutti*).\n\nHowever, the Exalted One did not explain this discourse by way of those *bhikkhus*; he explained it by way of the one who uses eight requisites (*aṭṭhaparikkhārika*).\n\nFor this one wraps up his small knife and needle in his water strainer, puts the strainer inside his almsbowl, hangs the bowl over his shoulder, clothes himself in his three robes and waistband, and sets out happily wherever he wishes.\n\nThere is nothing at all he has to turn back for and take.\n\nThus, showing such a *bhikkhu*'s light mode of living (*sallahukavuttitaṃ*), the Exalted One says: \"A *bhikkhu* is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly,\" etc.\n\nThere, \"with robes to protect his body\" means with only as much as is needed to protect his body.\n\n\"To sustain his belly\" means with only as much as is needed to sustain his belly.\n\nHe sets out taking only along with him— He goes taking all his minimal eight requisites, carrying them on his body.\n\nHe has no attachment or bondage to \"my monastery (*vihāra*), my cell (*pariveṇaṃ*), my attendant (*upaṭṭhāko*).\"\n\nHe is like an arrow released from the bow or like an elephant in rut which has left the herd. Using whatever dwelling he likes—a jungle thicket (*vanasaṇḍaṃ*), the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūlaṃ*), a wooded slope (*vanapabbhāraṃ*)—he stands alone and sits alone.\n\nIn all postures, he is alone, without a companion.\n\nThus he conducts himself in a manner similar to that of the rhinoceros, as explained.\n\nNow, to illustrate that meaning by means of a simile, [the text] begins \"Just as...\".\n\nThere, a bird (*pakkhī*) is a creature with wings (*pakkhayutto*), a bird (*sakuṇo*).\n\n\"It flies\" means it soars up.\n\nThis, in brief, is the meaning: Having learned that in such and such a region there is a tree with ripened fruits, birds (*sakuṇā*) come from various directions and eat those fruits, picking and tearing at them with their claws, wings, and beaks.\n\nIt never occurs to them, \"This is for today's meal, that is for tomorrow's meal.\"\n\nWhen the fruits are finished they do not set up a guard around that tree, nor do they set up a feather, claw mark, or beak mark there.\n\nRather, they lose their concern for that tree, and each bird goes in whatever direction it wishes, flying off with its wings as its only burden.\nIn the same way, this *bhikṣu* (monk) sets out wherever he wishes, without attachment (*nissaṅga*) and without concern (*nirapekṣa*).\nHence it is said: “He sets out taking only along with him.”",

    "commentary_english": "216. What does *soiminā cātiādinā* indicate? It indicates the accomplishment of the requisites for forest dwelling (*araññavāsa*).\n\nFor one who lacks these four requisites, his forest life does not succeed.\n\nHe would fall under the same category as animals or forest wanderers.\n\nThe deities residing in the forest would think, “What is the use of living in the forest for such an evil *bhikkhu*?” They would make frightful sounds, strike him on the head with their hands, and make him flee.\n\nA bad reputation would also spread about concerning him: “Such and such a *bhikkhu*, having entered the forest, did this and that evil deed.”\n\nBut one who has achieved these four requisites succeeds in his forest life.\n\nReviewing his own moral discipline (*sīla*), he does not see any stain or blemish, and he arouses rapture (*pīti*). Exploring that rapture by way of its destruction and falling away, he enters upon the plane of the noble ones (*ariyabhūmi*).\n\nThe deities residing in the forest are satisfied and speak praise of him.\n\nHis fame spreads widely, like a drop of oil put onto water.\n\nTherein, “secluded” (*vivitta*) means empty (*śūnya*), that is, quiet (*appasadda*) and noiseless (*appanigghosa*).\n\nIt is referring to this that it is said in the *Vibhaṅga*: “Secluded (*vivitta*)”: even if a dwelling (*senāsana*) is nearby, if it is not crowded with householders (*gahaṭṭha*) and monks (*pabbajita*),\n\nthen it is secluded.\n\nA dwelling (*senāsana*) is a place where one lies down and sits; it is a designation for bed, chair and so on (*mañcapīṭhādīnam*).\n\nThus it is said: “'Dwelling (*senāsana*)': a bed (*mañca*) is a dwelling, a chair (*pīṭha*) is a dwelling, a cushion (*bhisi*), a pillow (*bimbohana*), a dwelling place (*vihāra*), a building with a sloping roof (*aḍḍhayoga*), a rectangular building with a gabled roof (*pāsāda*), a flat-roofed building (*hammiya*), a natural cave (*guhā*), a multi-storeyed mansion (*aṭṭa*), a circular house (*māḷa*), a rock cave (*leṇa*), a bamboo thicket (*veḷugumba*), the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūla*), a pavilion (*maṇḍapa*)— these are also dwellings. Or any place to which *bhikkhus* return, all this is a dwelling\".\n\nMoreover, dwellings become fourfold as follows: A dwelling place (*vihāra*), a building with a sloping roof (*aḍḍhayoga*), a rectangular building with a gabled roof (*pāsāda*), a flat-roofed building (*hammiya*), a natural cave (*guhā*)—these are called dwelling-place dwellings.\n\nA bed (*mañca*), a chair (*pīṭha*), a cushion (*bhisi*), a pillow (*bimbohana*)— these are called bed-and-chair dwellings.\n\nA rug (*cimilika*), a piece of leather (*cammakhaṇḍa*), a straw mat (*tiṇasanthāra*), a mat of leaves (*paṇṇasanthāra*)—these are called spread dwellings.\n\n“Or any place to which *bhikkhus* return”—this is called a living space dwelling.\n\nThus dwelling (*senāsana*) is fourfold; all that is included by the term dwelling (*senāsanaggahaṇena*).\n\nHere, however, the Buddha is showing the dwelling appropriate for a *bhikkhu* who is similar to a bird, at home in all four quarters of the world; then he says “he resorts to a forest (*arañña*), the foot of a tree (*rukkhamūla*) and so on.”\n\nForest (*arañña*): having gone out beyond the boundary post (*indakhīlā*), all that is forest.\n\n\\- in the case of *bhikkhunis*,\n\nbut for the *bhikkhu* described here, it is fitting for his forest dwelling to be at least five hundred bow-lengths distant.\n\nIts characteristics are explained in the *Visuddhimagga*, in the “Description of the Ascetic Practices”.\n\n“The foot of a tree (*rukkhamūla*)” is the foot of any secluded tree (*vivittarukkhamūla*) having cool shade (*sandacchāyaṃ*).\n\n“A mountain (*pabbata*)” is a rock mountain (*selaṃ*).\n\nFor when one has bathed and drunk in a rock tank and sits down in the cool shade of a tree, fanned by a cool breeze, the various quarters all visible, the mind (*citta*) becomes one-pointed (*ekagga*).\n\n“A glen (*kandara*)” is a mountainous region (*pabbatapadesaṃ*) divided by water; what is called water (*udakaṃ*) is divided (*dāritaṃ*) by it, divided (*bhinnaṃ*) by water (*udakena*).\n\nsome say it is a place where rivers rush and roar.\n\nFor there the sand is like silver foil; the jungle thicket overhead is like a jewel-studded canopy, and the water flows like a mass of jewels.\n\nHaving entered such a glen, drunk and cooled one’s limbs, heaped up sand and prepared a seat from rag-robes (*paṃsukūlacīvaraṃ*), when one sits down and does the work of a recluse (*samaṇadhammaṃ*), the mind (*citta*) becomes one-pointed (*ekaggaṃ*).\n\n“A hillside cave (*giriguha*)” is a large fissure (*mahāvivaraṃ*) between two mountains or in a single mountain similar to a tunnel (*umaggasadisaṃ*). The characteristics of a cremation ground (*susānalakkhaṇaṃ*) are explained in the *Visuddhimagga*.\n\n“A jungle grove (*vanapattha*)” is a place beyond the outskirts of a village, a place not frequented by men, where they do not sow and plough. Thence it is said: “'A jungle grove (*vanapattha*)': this is a designation for remote dwellings (*senāsanānaṃ*).”\n\n“The open air (*abbhokāsa*)”: an uncovered place (*acchannaṃ*).\n\nOne wishing to may make a tent and live here.\n\n“A heap of straw (*palālapuñja*)”: a pile of straw (*palālarāsi*).\n\nFor having collected straw (*palālaṃ*) from a large heap of straw (*mahāpalālapuñjato*), they build an abode similar to a hillside cave (*pabbhāraleṇasadise ālaye*). They also throw straw (*palālaṃ*) over bushes and brush, etc., sit beneath it, and do the work of a recluse (*samaṇadhammaṃ*).\nThis was said with reference to him (taṃ sandhāyetaṃ vuttaṃ).\n\"After the meal\" means after the food.\n\"Returned from alms-seeking\" means returned from the search for alms.\n\"Crosswise\" (pallaṅkaṃ) means the sitting position with the thighs fully locked (samantato ūrubaddhāsanaṃ).\nFolded: having locked (ābhujitvā ti bandhitvā).\n\"Having straightened the body\" (ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya) means setting the upper body straight, aligning the eighteen vertebrae end to end (uparimaṃ sarīraṃ ujuṃ ṭhapetvā aṭṭhārasa piṭṭhikaṇṭakaṭṭhike koṭiyā koṭiṃ paṭipādetvā).\nFor when one sits in such a way, the skin, flesh, and sinews do not bend forward (evañhi nisinnassa cammamaṃsañhārūni na paṇamanti).\nAnd so the feelings that would arise moment by moment because of their being bent forward do not arise (athassa yā tesaṃ paṇamanapaccayā khaṇe khaṇe vedanā uppajjeyyuṃ, tā nuppajjanti).\nAs those feelings do not arise, the mind becomes one-pointed, the meditation subject does not collapse, [but] attains to growth, success, and maturity (tāsu anuppajjamānāsu cittaṃ ekaggaṃ hoti, kammaṭṭhānaṃ na paripatati, vuḍḍhiṃ phātiṃ vepullaṃ upagacchati).\n\"Having established mindfulness in front of him\" (parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā) means having placed mindfulness facing the meditation subject (kammaṭṭhānābhimukhaṃ satiṃ ṭhapayitvā).\nOr, having made it near the mouth, is the meaning (mukhasamīpe vā katvāti attho).\nThus it is said in the *Vibhaṅga*: “This mindfulness is set up, set up well, at the tip of the nose or at the sign of the mouth, hence it is said 'having established mindfulness in front of him'\" (teneva vibhaṅge vuttaṃ – \"ayaṃ sati upaṭṭhitā hoti sūpaṭṭhitā nāsikagge vā mukhanimitte vā, tena vuccati parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā\"ti).\nOr, *pari* has the sense of embracing (*pariggahaṭṭho*).\n*Mukhaṃ* has the sense of outlet (*niyyānaṭṭho*).\n*Sati* has the sense of establishment (*upaṭṭhānaṭṭho*).\nTherefore, it is said: \"Mindfulness in front\" (tena vuccati – \"parimukhaṃ sati\"nti).\nThus, in the *Paṭisambhidā*, the meaning should be understood in the manner that has been stated (evaṃ paṭisambhidāyaṃ vuttanayenapettha attho daṭṭhabbo).\nHere, in brief: \"Having made mindfulness the grasping of the outlet\" (tatrāyaṃ saṅkhepo – \"pariggahitaniyyānasatiṃ katvā\"ti).",

Therefore, the meaning here is: having abandoned lust ( *rāga*) for the five aggregates of clinging, having suppressed sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*).\n\n“He dwells with a mind free from covetousness” (*vigatābhijjhena*): with a mind free from covetousness through its being abandoned by way of suppression, not like eye-consciousness which is naturally devoid of covetousness. This is the meaning.\n\n\"He purifies his mind from covetousness\" (*abhijjhāya cittaṃ parisodheti*): he releases his mind from covetousness ( *abhijjhā*); he liberates the mind (*cittaṃ parimoceti*).\n\nHe acts in such a way that he lets go of it and does not grasp it again. This is the meaning.\n\nThe same method applies in the cases of abandoning ill-will and hatred (*byāpādapadosaṃ pahāya*), and so forth.\n\n“Ill will” (*byāpādo*): the mind (*cittaṃ*) is made ill by this, and abandons its original nature (*purimapakatiṃ vijahati*), like spoiled gruel.\n\n“Hatred” (*padoso*): one is defiled by undergoing deformation ( *vikārāpattiyā padussati*), or one defiles and destroys others ( *paraṃ vā padūseti vināseti*).\n\nBoth these words are designations for anger ( *kodha*).\n\n“Dullness” (*thinaṃ*) is sickness of the mind (*cittagelaññaṃ*).\n\n“Drowsiness” (*middhaṃ*) is sickness of mental factors (*cetasikagelaññaṃ*); together dullness (*thinañca*) and drowsiness (*middhañca*) are called \"dullness and drowsiness\" (*thinamiddhaṃ*).\n\n“Perceiving light” (*ālokasaññī*): he is endowed with a purified perception (*parisuddhāya saññāya samannāgato*) free from the hindrances (*vigatanīvaraṇāya*), capable of perceiving, whether by day or by night, a light previously seen (*divādiṭṭhālokasañjānanasamatthāya*).\n\n“Mindful and clearly comprehending” (*sato sampajānoti*): he is endowed with mindfulness ( *satiyā*) and knowledge ( *ñāṇena*).\n\nThese two are mentioned because they are both helpful to the perception of light (*ālokasaññāya upakārattā vuttaṃ*).\n\nExcitement (*uddhaccañca*) and remorse (*kukkuccañca*) are excitement and remorse (*uddhaccakukkuccaṃ*).\n\nHe has “passed beyond doubt” (*tiṇṇavicikiccho*) in that he lives having crossed over and transcended doubt (*vicikicchaṃ taritvā atikkamitvā ṭhito*).\n\nHe does not waver, thinking, \"How is this? How is this?\" (*kathamidaṃ kathamidaṃ*). Therefore he is free from doubt (*akathaṃkathī*).\n\nHe is “unperplexed about wholesome states” (*kusalesu dhammesu*) because, in regard to blameless states ( *anavajjesu dhammesu*),\n\nhe does not doubt: “Are these wholesome? How is it that these are wholesome?\" (*ime nu kho kusalā kathamime kusalā*)\n\nThe meaning is, he does not waver (*na kaṅkhati*).\n\nThis is a brief explanation (*ayamettha saṅkhepo*).\n\nWhatever has to be said concerning these five hindrances (*imesu pana nīvaraṇesu*)—the analysis of their word derivations, characteristics, etc.—all has been said in the *Visuddhimagga*.",

When these five hindrances are unabandoned, here the Exalted One shows the unabandoned hindrance of sensual desire (*kāmacchanda-nīvaraṇa*) as similar to a debt (*iṇa-sadisaṃ*), and the remaining hindrances as similar to sickness, etc.\n\nThe similarity (*sadisatā*) is as follows.\n\nOne who has taken a debt (*iṇaṃ*) from others and squandered it cannot defend himself when they tell him to pay back his debt (*iṇaṃ dehi*), speak to him harshly, bind him and beat him; he must endure this all.\n\nHis debt (*iṇaṃ*) is the reason he must endure it.\n\nSimilarly, if someone becomes excited by sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*) towards someone else and takes that person as an object of a mind associated with craving (*taṇhā-sahagatena*), then he must endure it all when that person—the object of his sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*)—speaks to him harshly, binds him and beats him; his sensual desire (*kāmacchanda*) is the reason he must endure it. An example is the case of women being beaten by the house-owners, their sensual desire being the reason they must endure it. Thus sensual desire (*kāmacchando*) should be regarded as a debt (*iṇaṃ viya*).\n\nOne who is afflicted with a bile disease, if he is given such things as honey and sugar, will not enjoy their taste because of his bile disease. He will spit them out thinking they are bitter.\n\nSimilarly, if one with a mind of ill will (*byāpannacitto*) is exhorted even slightly by his benevolent preceptor (*ācariya*) or teacher (*upajjhāya*), he will not accept the exhortation.\n\nHe will reject it, saying “You oppress me too much! ” and depart.\n\nJust as the man afflicted with a bile disease cannot enjoy the taste of honey and sugar, so one afflicted with anger cannot enjoy the flavor of the Buddha’s dispensation (*sāsana-rasaṃ*), that is, the happiness of *jhāna*, etc.\n\nThus ill will (*byāpādo*) should be regarded as a sickness (*rogo viya*).\n\nOn a festival day a man bound in prison cannot see either the beginning (*ādiṃ*), middle (*majjhaṃ*), or end (*pariyosānaṃ*) of the festival.\n\nIf he is released the next day, and he hears, “Oh, there was a delightful festival yesterday! Oh, such dances and songs! ” he cannot give a reply.\n\nWhy? Because he did not experience the festival (*nakkhattassa ananubhūtattā*).\n\nSimilarly, if a *bhikkhu* is overcome by dullness and drowsiness (*thinamiddhābhibhūto*) when a preaching of the Dhamma (*dhamma-ssavane*) through variegated methods is taking place, he cannot understand its beginning (*ādiṃ*), middle (*majjhaṃ*), or end (*pariyosānaṃ*).\n\nWhen the preaching is over he hears others speaking praise of it, “Oh, what a preaching of the Dhamma! Such arguments (*kāraṇaṃ*) and similes (*upamā*)! ” but he cannot give a reply.\n\nWhy? Because he was overcome by dullness and drowsiness (*thinamiddha-vasena*) and did not enjoy the Dhamma talk (*dhamma-kathāya ananubhūtattā*).\n\nThus dullness and drowsiness (*thinamiddhaṃ*) should be regarded as confinement in prison (*bandhanāgāraṃ viya*).\n\nA slave, even when playing at a festival (*nakkhattaṃ kīḷanto*), may be told: “There is some urgent task (*accāyikaṃ karaṇīyaṃ*) for you to do. Go there quickly!\n\nIf you don’t go, I’ll cut off your hands (*hattha-pādaṃ*) and feet, your ears (*kaṇṇa*) or your nose (*nāsaṃ*)! ” Thus he goes quickly.\n\nHe is unable to experience the beginning (*ādi*), middle (*majjha*) and end (*pariyosānaṃ*) of the festival. Why? Because he is subservient (*parādhīnatāya*). Similarly, when one who is unskilled in the *Vinaya* (*apakataññunā*) has entered the forest for seclusion (*vivekatthāya araññaṃ paviṭṭhena*), he may incur some minor disciplinary offense, even perceiving unallowable meat (*akappiya-maṃsa-saññāya*) as allowable (*kappiya-maṃsepi*). Then he has to abandon his seclusion (*vivekaṃ pahāya*) and approach a master of the *Vinaya* (*vinayadharassa santikaṃ*) to purify his moral discipline (*sīla-visodhanatthaṃ*). Thus he does not get to enjoy the happiness of seclusion (*viveka-sukhaṃ*). Why? Because he is overcome by restlessness and worry (*uddhacca-kukkucca-ābhibhūtatāyāti*).\n\nThus restlessness and worry (*uddhacca-kukkuccaṃ*) should be regarded as slavery (*dāsabyaṃ viya*).\n\nA man traveling along a desert road (*kantāraddhānamaggappaṭipanno*), having seen the opportunity for thieves (*corehi*) to plunder and kill people, becomes anxious and frightened even by the sound of a twig (*daṇḍaka-saddena*) or a bird (*sakuṇa-saddena*), thinking “Thieves have come (*corā āgatā*)!” He goes forward a little, stops because of his anxiety and fear, and turns back thinking, “Who knows what will happen if one travels in such a desert?”. The places in which he stops are more numerous than those in which he walks.\n\nHe reaches a place of safety with trouble and difficulty, or he may not reach it at all.\n\nSimilarly, if doubt (*vicikicchā*) about the eight cases has arisen in someone, he will go on doubting “Is the *Buddha* an Enlightened One or not? ” and will not be able to resolve and accept it in faith (*saddhāya gaṇhituṃ*).\n\nNot being able to do so, he does not reach the path (*maggaṃ*) or fruit (*phalaṃ*).\n\nThus, just as the traveler on the desert road (*kantāraddhānamagge*), by doubting whether or not there are thieves (*corā atthi natthī*), repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation (*āsappana-parisappanaṃ*), lack of conviction and consternation (*chambhitattaṃ*), and creates an obstacle (*antarāyaṃ karoti*) to his reaching a place of safety (*khemanta-pattiyā*), so by doubting whether or not the *Buddha* is an Enlightened One, one repeatedly arouses wavering and vacillation (*āsappana-parisappanaṃ*), lack of conviction and consternation (*chambhitattaṃ*), and creates an obstacle to one’s reaching the plane of the noble ones (*ariya-bhūmi-pattiyā antarāyaṃ karotīti*). Thus doubt (*vicikicchā*) should be regarded as a desert road (*kantāraddhānamaggo viya*).",

    "commentary_english": "224. Now, just as the Exalted One, in the passage \"Suppose, O great king, [a man free from debt...],\" shows the abandoning of the hindrance of sensual desire as similar to freedom from debt (āṇaṇya), and the abandoning of the remaining hindrances as similar to good health (ārogya), etc.\n\nHerein lies the similarity: just as a man, having taken a loan (iṇaṃ ādāya), applies it to his business (kammante payojetvā) and achieves success (samiddhataṃ patto), thinks, \"This debt (iṇaṃ) is a root impediment (palibodhamūla),\" so he pays back the loan (iṇaṃ) together with the interest (savaḍḍhikaṃ) and has the promissory note (paṇṇaṃ) torn up (phālāpeyya).\n\nFrom then on, no one sends him a messenger (dūtaṃ peseti) or a letter (paṇṇaṃ).\n\nWhen he sees his creditors (iṇasāmike disvāpi), he may rise up from his seat (āsanā uṭṭhahati) or remain seated (no ce na uṭṭhahati), as he wishes. Why? Because of his detachment (nillepatāya) and non-attachment (alaggatāya) towards them.\n\nJust so, a bhikkhu (bhikkhu) thinks, \"This sensual desire (kāmacchando) is a root impediment (palibodhamūla),\" so he develops (bhāvetvā) six things (cha dhamme) and abandons (pajahati) the hindrance of sensual desire (kāmacchandanīvaraṇaṃ).\n\nWe shall describe (vaṇṇayissāma) those six things (cha dhamme) in the Great Frames of Reference (mahāsatipaṭṭhāne).\n\nWhen he has thus abandoned sensual desire (pahīnakāmacchandassa), then just as a man free from debt (iṇamuttassa purisassa) experiences no fear (bhayaṃ) or consternation (chambhitattaṃ) when he sees his creditor (iṇassāmike disvā),\n\nso the bhikkhu experiences no attachment (saṅgo) or bondage (baddho) towards any external object (paravatthumhi).\n\nEven if he sees divine forms (dibbāni rūpāni passato), no defilement (kileso) assails him (na samudācarati).\n\nTherefore (tasmā), the Exalted One (bhagavā) says that the abandonment of sensual desire (kāmacchandappahānaṃ) is like freedom from debt (āṇaṇyamiva).\n\nJust as a man (puriso) afflicted with a bile disease (pittarogāturo) suppresses (vūpasametvā) that disease (rogaṃ) with a preparation of medicines (bhesajjakiriyāya). From then on (tato paṭṭhāya) he enjoys (vindati) the taste (rasaṃ) of such things as honey (madhu) and sugar (sakkara), etc. (ādīnaṃ).\n\nJust so (evameva), a bhikkhu (bhikkhu) thinks (cintetvā), \"This ill will (byāpādo) is a major cause of harm (mahā anatthakaro),\" so he develops (bhāvetvā) six things (cha dhamme) and abandons (pajahati) the hindrance of ill will (byāpādanīvaraṇaṃ).\n\nWe shall describe (vaṇṇayissāma) those six things (cha dhamme) in all the hindrances (sabbanīvaraṇesu) in the Great Frames of Reference (mahāsatipaṭṭhāneyeva).\n\nNot only (na kevalañca) those alone (teyeva), but also (yepi) those which should be developed (bhāvetabbā) for the abandoning (pahānāya) of dullness and drowsiness (thinamiddhādīnaṃ), etc., all (sabbe) of those (tepi) we shall describe (vaṇṇayissāma) there (tattheva).\n\nWhen he has thus abandoned ill will (pahīnabyāpādo), then just as a man (puriso) who has recovered from bile disease (pittarogavimutto) eats (paṭisevati) such things as honey (madhu) and sugar (sakkara) and relishes (sampiyāyamāno) their taste (rasaṃ), so the bhikkhu (bhikkhu), having respectfully received (sirasā sampaṭicchitvā) the training rules (sikkhāpadāni) such as the promulgations concerning conduct (ācārapaṇṇattiādīni), etc., trains himself (sikkhati) in them and relishes them (sampiyāyamāno).\n\nTherefore (tasmā), the Exalted One (bhagavā) says that the abandonment of ill will (byāpādappahānaṃ) is like good health (ārogyamiva).\n\nJust as a man (puriso) who was placed (pavesito) in prison (bandhanāgāraṃ) on a festival day (nakkhattadivase), on a later festival day (aparasmiṃ nakkhattadivase) thinks, \"Previously (pubbepi), I was bound (baddho) due to my own heedlessness (pamādadosena), and thence (tena) I did not enjoy (nānubhaviṃ) the festival (nakkhattaṃ).\n\nNow (idāni) I will be heedful (appamatto bhavissāmi).\" Thus (yathāssa) he becomes heedful (appamatto hutvā), so that his foes (paccatthikā) do not get the chance (okāsaṃ na labhanti). Having enjoyed (anubhavitvā) the festival (nakkhattaṃ), he utters (udānesi) the joyful exclamation (udānaṃ), \"Oh, what a festival (aho nakkhattaṃ)! Oh what a festival (aho nakkhattaṃ)!\" Just so (evameva), a bhikkhu (bhikkhu) thinks, \"This dullness and drowsiness (thinamiddhaṃ) are a major cause of harm (mahāanatthakara),\" so he develops (bhāvetvā) six things (cha dhamme) and abandons (pajahati) the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness (thinamiddhanīvaraṇaṃ). When he has thus abandoned dullness and drowsiness (pahīnathinamiddho), then just as a man (puriso) freed from imprisonment (bandhanā mutto) enjoys (anubhavati) the beginning (ādimajjhapariyosānaṃ), middle, and end of even a week (sattāhampi) of the festival (nakkhattassa), so the bhikkhu (bhikkhu), experiencing (anubhavanto) the beginning (ādimajjhapariyosānaṃ), middle, and end of the festival of the Dhamma (dhammanakkhattassa) together with the discriminations (paṭisambhidāhi), attains (pāpuṇāti) arahantship (arahattaṃ).\n\nTherefore (tasmā), the Exalted One (bhagavā) says that the abandonment of dullness and drowsiness (thinamiddhappahānaṃ) is like release from prison (bandhanā mokkhamiva).\n\nJust as a slave (dāso), with the help of (upanissāya) a friend (mittaṃ), gives (datvā) money (dhanaṃ) to his masters (sāmikānaṃ) and frees himself from slavery (attānaṃ bhujissaṃ katvā). From then on (tato paṭṭhāya) he can do (karoti) whatever (yaṃ) he wishes (icchati).\n\nJust so (evameva), a bhikkhu (bhikkhu) thinks, \"This restlessness and worry (uddhaccakukkuccaṃ) are a major cause of harm (mahā anatthakara),\" so he develops (bhāvetvā) six things (cha dhamme) and abandons (pajahati) restlessness and worry (uddhaccakukkuccaṃ).\n\nWhen he has thus abandoned restlessness and worry (pahīnauddhaccakukkucco), then just as a free man (bhujisso puriso) can do (karoti) whatever (yaṃ) he wishes (icchati), and no one (koci) can forcibly (balakkārena) prevent him from doing so (tato nivatteti), so the bhikkhu (bhikkhu) happily (yathā sukhaṃ) practices (paṭipajjati) the way of renunciation (nekkhammapaṭipadaṃ), and restlessness and worry (uddhaccakukkuccaṃ) cannot forcibly (balakkārena) prevent him from doing so (tato nivatteti).\n\nTherefore (tasmā), the Exalted One (bhagavā) says that the abandonment of restlessness and worry (uddhaccakukkuccappahānaṃ) is like freedom from slavery (bhujissaṃ viya).\n\nJust as a strong man (balavā puriso), having taken his valuables (hatthasāraṃ gahetvā) in hand, might travel (paṭipajjeyya) through a desert (kantāraṃ) fully armed (sajjāvudho), accompanied by his retinue (saparivāro). Thieves (corā), having seen (disvā) him even from afar (dūratova), would flee (palāyeyyuṃ).\n\nHe (so), safely (sotthinā) crossing (nittharitvā) that desert (taṃ kantāraṃ), reaching (patto) a place of safety (khemantaṃ), would be joyful and delighted (haṭṭhatuṭṭho assa).\n\nJust so (evameva), a bhikkhu (bhikkhu) thinks, \"This doubt (vicikicchā) is a major cause of harm (mahā anatthakārikā),\" so he develops (bhāvetvā) six things (cha dhamme) and abandons (pajahati) doubt (vicikicchaṃ).\n\nWhen he has thus abandoned doubt (pahīnavicikiccho), then just as a strong man (balavā puriso) fully armed (sajjāvudho), accompanied by his retinue (saparivāro), fearless (nibbhayo), taking no more account of thieves (core) than of grass (tiṇaṃ viya agaṇetvā), safely (sotthinā) leaving (nikkhamitvā), arrives (pāpuṇāti) at a place of safety (khemantabhūmiṃ), so the bhikkhu (bhikkhu), crossing (nittharitvā) the desert of misconduct (duccaritakantāraṃ), arrives (pāpuṇāti) at the supreme (paramaṃ) place of safety (khemantabhūmiṃ), the deathless (amataṃ), the great Nibbāna (mahānibbānaṃ).\n\nTherefore (tasmā), the Exalted One (bhagavā) says that the abandonment of doubt (vicikicchāpahānaṃ) is like a place of safety (khemantabhūmiṃ viya).",

    "commentary_english": "232-233.\n\nIn the simile of the happiness of the fourth *jhāna* (catutthajjhāna), \"with a pure mind, perfectly white\" (*parisuddhena cetasā pariyodātena*)—here, \"pure\" (*parisuddhaṃ*) should be understood in the sense of being without defilement (*nirupakkilesaṭṭhena*), and \"perfectly white\" (*pariyodātaṃ*) in the sense of being radiant (*pabhassaraṭṭhena*).\n\n\"With a white cloth\" (*odātena vattheṇa*)—this was said for the purpose of showing suffusion by heat (*utupharaṇatthaṃ*).\n\nFor there is no suffusion by heat (*utupharaṇaṃ*) with a soiled cloth (*kiliṭṭhavatthena*); with a clean cloth (*taṅkhaṇadhotaparisuddhena*) that has just been washed, the suffusion by heat (*utupharaṇaṃ*) is strong (*balavaṃ hoti*).\n\nFor in this simile (*imissāya hi upamāya*), the material body (*karajakāyo*) is like the cloth (*vatthaṃ viya*), and the happiness of the fourth *jhāna* (catutthajjhānasukhaṃ) is like the suffusion by heat (*utupharaṇaṃ viya*).\n\nTherefore, just as when a man (*purisassa*) has bathed well (*sunhātassa*) and is sitting covered from the head down (*sasīsaṃ pārupitvā nisinnassa*) by a clean cloth (*parisuddhaṃ vatthaṃ*), the heat (*utu*) from his body (*sarīrato*) suffuses the entire cloth (*sabbameva vatthaṃ pharati*),\n\nso that there is no part of the cloth (*vatthassa*) not suffused by heat (*aphuṭokāso hoti*),\n\nsimilarly, there is no part of the *bhikkhu*'s material body (*karajakāyassa*) that is not suffused by the happiness of the fourth *jhāna* (*catutthajjhānasukhena*) (*na koci okāso aphuṭo hotīti*).\n\nIt is in this way (*evamettha*) that the meaning (*attho*) should be seen (*daṭṭhabbo*).\n\nA step-by-step explanation (*anupadavaṇṇanā*) of these four *jhānas* (*imesaṃ pana catunnaṃ jhānānaṃ*), and of the method of developing them (*bhāvanānayo ca*), is given in the *Visuddhimagga*, thus they are not explained in detail here (*idha na vitthārito*).\n\nIt should not be thought (*na veditabbo*) that at this point (*ettāvatā*) only the one who gains the material-form *jhānas* (*rūpajjhānalābhīyeva*) has been shown, but not the one who gains the immaterial *jhānas* (*na arūpajjhānalābhīti*).\n\nFor there can be no achievement of the higher direct knowledges (*upari abhiññādhigamo hoti*) without achieving mastery (*vasībhāvaṃ vinā*) in fourteen ways (*cuddasahākārehi*) over the eight meditative attainments (*aṭṭhasu samāpattīsu*).\n\nIn the text (*pāḷiyaṃ pana*) only the material-form *jhānas* (*rūpajjhānāniyeva*) have come down (*āgatāni*),\n\nbut the immaterial *jhānas* (*arūpajjhānāni*) should be brought in and explained (*āharitvā kathetabbāni*).",
